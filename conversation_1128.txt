User: I need to get to St. Petersburg to shoot another movie. Im in Guadalajara
Wizard: Sorry to inform you we currently do not offer flights between those two cities. Is there somewhere else you'd like to go?
User: this happened last time too ugh. I’m kind of getting sick of Selena always ranting about her Justin and Demi problems ugh. I’ll just go to Goiania anyway and hope for the best.
