User: The police are after me, and I need to leave Kobe between August 27 and September 2.
Wizard: Hi! I can help you with booking a trip from Kobe for your requested dates. Now, where would you like to go today?
User: Take me anywhere, but I only have $4600 cash.
Wizard: I can book you four days in Sapporo for 200.92USD!
User: Four days may not be long enough... what else do you have?
Wizard: How about 6 days in San Jose for 2045.99USD?
User: That should be alright. Does the room have a safe?
Wizard: This four star hotel has free wifi, free parking, and free breakfast!
User: Perfect! So if I steal a car I can park it there! I'll have to call the hotel about the safe, what is the name of the hotel?
Wizard: It's the Tranquil Seaside Inn.
User: And free parking?
Wizard: Yes! Tranquil Seaside Inn is the hotel I quoted for you before.
User: Oh yes ok. This one sounds good to me!
