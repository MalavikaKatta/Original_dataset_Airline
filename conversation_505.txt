User: Hi there, I’m off between August 25 and September 11. I saved up 4000 for a nice trip. If I flew out from San Francisco, what are your suggestions for where I can go?
Wizard: For that budget you could travel to cities in the US, Mexico, Brazil, Italy or Japan. Any preferences?
User: Excellent, I’ve always wanted to see Japan. What kind of hotel can I expect?
Wizard: Great, let me check what I have. First, can I just confirm with you that this is a trip for one adult?
User: Yes it is
Wizard: Great, thank you, In that case I can offer you 15 days at HOTEL Sugoi, a 3 star hotel close to a Palace. You would be staying there between August 25th and September 7th. They offer free wifi and have an excellent guest rating of 8.49/10. The entire package costs 2024.25USD. Should I book this for you?
User: That sounds really good actually. Lets say I have a date I wanted to bring…would Japan be out of my price range then?
Wizard: Yes, unfortunately the packages I have for two in Japan do not fit in your budget. However I can offer you a 13 day beach getaway at the 3 star Rose Sierra Hotel in Santo Domingo. Would something like that interest you?
User: How are the guest ratings for that place?
Wizard: 7.06/10, so guests seem to be quite satisfied with the place.
User: TRUE. You know what, I’m not sure that I’m ready to ask her to travel with me yet anyway. Just book me for Sugoi
Wizard: I can do that for you! Thank you for using our services and have a great afternoon.
User: Thanks!
