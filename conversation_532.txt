Wizard: I'm afraid we do not currently have any available flights between those cities. Any other destinations I can search for you?
User: how bout puebla to fukuoka
Wizard: You could stay for 10 days at the Oceanside Hotel for 6371.69USD.
User: is that a good hotel?
Wizard: It depends what you are looking for. This one has 3.5 stars and is located in the heart of the city.
User: that is not a good hotel...is there a better one?
Wizard: We do not have hotels with more than 3.5 stars in Fukuoka 
User: i guess weâ€™ll have to settle for that... do you offer business class flights at least
Wizard: Yes we do, with business class flights the package costs 8275.17USD.
User: ok thats more like it just so i can feel okay about my decision
what amenities at the hotel?
Wizard: You will have free wifi.
User: and?
Wizard: That is the only amenity offered by this hotel. If you would also want free breakfast I can offer you 10 days at Historic Mansion Hotel which is a 3.5 star hotel.
User: No thats the last straw, we are taking our business elsewhere
