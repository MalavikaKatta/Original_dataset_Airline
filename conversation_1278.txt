User: Yes! I'm booking for 20 of us! Heard Recife is a sweet destination
Wizard: Wow, all 20 of you! Is there a budget in mind? And where will you all be coming from?
User: Open budget! We're based in Tofino.
Wizard: I'm afraid we do not have any flights that depart from Tofino. Would you like to choose another city of departure?
User: What??? :disappointed:
