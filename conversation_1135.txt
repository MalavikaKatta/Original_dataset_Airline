User: Hey, I need to get to Punta Cana! For some important business!
Wizard: Ok! From where?
User: From Tokyo. And I'll be bringing my kids with me.
Wizard: How many people in total?
User: 1 adult and 3 kids.
Wizard: And what is the budget for you all?
User: 11600
Wizard: Great! I have 5 or 6 day packages available. Do you have any preference?
User: Is a 6 day package the longest you have?
Wizard: Yes, it is.
User: How many 6 day packages do you have?
Wizard: Just one, but with either economy or business class flights.
User: How much is it and what does it include?
Wizard: 8320.93USD is the price for your family and the hotel is 2.5 stars, located on the beach.
User: That doesn't sound too bad. 
If I increase my budget, would you be able to get me a longer package deal?
Wizard: There is an 11 day package at an unrated hotel for 7909.84USD total.
User: So you do have something longer! Is that hotel also on a beach?
Wizard: No, it is near a palace.
User: That also sounds good. Any other longer package deals that you've been hiding from me?
Wizard: Shall I book?
User: Okay then, I'll book the 11 day package.
Wizard: Ok, great. Would you like to upgrade to Business class flights?
User: How much would that be?
Wizard: 10546.23USD
User: Sure, that sounds good. I'll take that! The children will enjoy it.
Wizard: Wonderful. Enjoy your stay
User: Thanks!
