User: So I hear there are just AMAZING pork belly sliders at this little food boutique in Ulsan. I reallllly wanna check out the foodie scene there!
Wizard: Sounds fun! Where will you be leaving from?
User: I'll be in Calgary for the rest of this week and I'm wondering if I can get there for 4000 dollars
Wizard: When is the earliest you can leave?
User: I'm free to go whenever
Wizard: We have a 5 star option from September 20th to 24th and another 5 star option from September 18th to 22nd.
User: Can you tell me about them?
Wizard: The 20th to 24th is at The Sapphire Time. The hotel is near a park, market, and theatre. They have a 8.98/10 guest rating and offer free parking and wifi. The price of this package is 3524.83. The 18th to 22nd is at the Escape Cave. The hotel is near a park, mall, and shopping.  They have a 8.8/10 guest rating and offer free parking and wifi also. The price of this package is 3505.18, so a little bit cheaper.
User: Very detailed - I appreciated that.However, as much as I do love the BBQ, I also have to look at Recife, as I also thoroughly enjoy the variety of food available there
For that one though could you look for flights out of New York?
I think I'd be stopping back there before heading out
Wizard: For Recife we have a 4 star hotel near a park, 8.22/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 13th to 24th, business flights are 3603.71, and economy flights are 2800.81.  This is The Glee.
User: That isn't bad.. but out of the two I'm gonna pick Sapphire Time. book that one for me, would ya?
Wizard: Sure! This package will automatically be booked once you confirm payment in the confirmation email just sent to you. Have a nice day and enjoy the trip!
