User: Ok I would like to go to Melbourne from Santiago Actually it can be any city
But on one condition: I want to travel for free
My guru told me that I could make anything happen if I dreamed hard enough and focused on making it a reality
So my dream is to travel for free and you will help make it happen
Wizard: There is no such thing as free trips in my system.
User: My guru told me that I would encounter haters on my path to enlightenment
It would now appear that you are a hater. What if I paid $400, where can I go from Melbourne
Wizard: I am sorry, I don't have anything for that budget.
User: Can you check again. I am sure there has got to be something for me. I have focused on this with all my mental energy for weeks now, guru said it would work...
Wizard: I am sorry.
