User: Hi there!
Wizard: How can I help you?
User: I am looking to fly out to Santos I can leave from two possible cities: one of them is Cancun
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: no budget. but it needs to be between tomorrow and September 20
Wizard: Do you have a hotel rating preference?
User: I think a 3 star should be suitable for me. I’m not a person with particularly fancy tastes, and neither are any of my 7 companions on this trip
Wizard: 8 adults altogether?
User: correct!
Wizard: Would you rather have a 19 day stay or 14 day stay?
User: I need something between the dates of September 3 and 20 ideally.
Wizard: One package is from September 4th to 21st and the other is from September 2nd to 14th.
User: There’s nothing shorter?
Wizard: No
User: Ok I suppose I can be flexible with my dates. Can you tell me more about the hotel?
Wizard: Which trip would you rather do?
User: leaning towards the 4th to 21st
Wizard: This a a 3 star hotel close to shopping, 8.37/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, business flights for 22417.40, economy flights for 17467.20.

Wizard: Would you like to book?
User: yeah
Wizard: Economy or business?
User: lets all do business class
Wizard: Great! Your package is booked! Have a great trip!
