Wizard: When would you like to go?
User: Ideally sometime between Tuesday September 13 and Wednesday September 28.
Wizard: Okay last question, will you be going alone or with others?
User: Nah just me.
Wizard: Great, we have two fantastic 5 star hotels in Berlin waiting for you! We offer 14 day or 15 packages. Would these interest you?
User: Yes please! Are they fairly affordable?
Wizard: They are! For the 15 day package, we have the business package available for 1608.47 and the economy package for 1264.47. The 14 day package is slightly more expensive.
User: The 14 day package is more expensive than the 15 day package one?
Wizard: Yes. The 14 day trip is 2752.48 for business and 2167.74 for economy.

Wizard: The 15 day trip is from Sept 14-28.
User: Wow that sounds great. What else can you tell me?
