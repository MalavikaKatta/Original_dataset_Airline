User: I guess my bride can go shopping while I go to the game. This sounds like a great package but I only have $900.
Wizard: Unfortunately that is the lowest price I can find for the given dates. Would you be open to changing the dates so that more pricing options are made available?
User: I guess $150 is not that big a deal and this one works with the games, just go ahead and book it. Thanks, bud.
Wizard: Excellent, I have booked your trip for you and will send you an email confirmation shortly. Bon voyage!
User: Merci!
