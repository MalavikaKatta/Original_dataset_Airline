Wizard: The best hotel we have in Las Vegas is a 3.0 star hotel. Would you like to know more about this option or do you have another possible destination?

Wizard: The best in Fortaleza is also a 3 star hotel.
User: Fukuoka?
Wizard: We do have a better option in Fukuoka. It's a 3.5 star hotel in the heart of the city with guest ratings of 8.22/10. Is this better?
