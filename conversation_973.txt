User: Correct.
Wizard: Do you have dates and length of stay desired?

Wizard: I have no packages for under $2000. best I can do is $2415.57 for 8 day stay.
User: Well, what if I left from Manaus to Hiroshima?
Wizard: Nothing in Hiroshima for under $2000.
User: I guess I’ll have to go to San Juan.
Wizard: Burlington to San Juan?
User: Sure. Go for it.
Wizard: Our best hotel in San Juan for under $2000 is the Fairyland, 4 STAR, wifi included , 10 day stay  all for one low price of  1277.49USD
User: Sounds good. Is it downtown? Near any nice dive bars or brew pubs?
Wizard: No but it's near the museum, shopping and market. I do not know if there are "dive bars or brew pubs" nearby.
User: Ok let’s book that package to San Juan please.
Wizard: Processing booking, have a nice weekend.
User: Thanks :smile:
