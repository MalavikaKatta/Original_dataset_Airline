User: glad to hear it! Ok so weâ€™d like to go to Brasilia for 11 days and between the two of us we have 3300
Wizard: Sorry, I don't have anything that matches your budget. Do you have any other places in mind
User: lets try going to fortaleza
Wizard: That sounds like a nice choice! I can take you there for 10 days. You can stay at a 3 star hotel close to the mall. How does that sound?
User: and it fits in our budget?
Wizard: Sure does! You can jump on economy seats for 3265.0!
User: do we have to pay for breakfast at the hotel?
Wizard: Nope, they've got it covered! Same with wifi and parking.
