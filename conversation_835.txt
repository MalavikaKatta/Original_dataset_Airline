User: Hello there. I am the father of a group of 4 spoiled, privileged brats
I've decided to book them a trip to see how those in less fortunate parts of the world live
Give them some perspective, you know?
See if you can get me, my wife, and the four kids to Guadalajara, from Calgary
Wizard: Can you please confirm the number of adults and the number of children that will be travelling together?
User: 2 and 4
Wizard: Calgary to Guadalajara is not a destination that we service. Can you provide either a new departure city or a new destination city?
User: I suppose we _could_ take them to Rio de Janeiro also
Wizard: Calgary to Rio de Janeiro does not come up either.
User: Do you think I could still get the message across if we went to San Juan?
Wizard: You would have to fly out of somewhere else than Calgary for those specific destinations.
User: That is not an option
