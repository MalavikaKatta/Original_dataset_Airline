User: I'd like to go to Washington.
Wizard: Sure thing :slightly_smiling_face: Where would you like to leave from?
User: Naples
Wizard: Sorry but we do not offer trips straight from Naples to Washington. Is there another destination you would consider?
User: I also had Sao Paulo in my mind..
Wizard: Ok! I have two hotels available: a 2 star and a 3 star - both with 6.91 guest ratings.
User: The 3 star would be great if it's under my budget of 5600..
Wizard: It sure is! You could even fly business class for  2893.46USD total.
User: Great let's book it!
Wizard: Consider it booked :slightly_smiling_face:
User: Thanks!
