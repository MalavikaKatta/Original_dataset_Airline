User: Hi. I’m working with a tight budget
Turns out there’s not much pay for struggling, mildly alcoholic writers
I know, right?
Anyway
Looking for a bit of a break
Have 2500 to spend on a trip for my wife, me, and our son
Can you get us from Brasilia to Essen?
Wizard: Wish I could help, but there are no trips from Brasilia to Essen. Is there somewhere else you want to go?
User: How about Brasilia to San Diego?
Wizard: Sorry, nothing that works for your budget.
