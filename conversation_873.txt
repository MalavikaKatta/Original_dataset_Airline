User: And how much does this cost?
Wizard: 16174.2 if you fly economy.
User: Ok I think I want to narrow it down to this one or Ulsan Can you give me more detail on that hotel?
Wizard: Absolutely! The hotel in Ulsan is close to a market and a palace. It offers free wifi and parking. In the past, guests have rated it 7.06/10. The 14 day package costs 3553.83. We also have a business package available for this option if that's something of interest to you.
User: this is also very attractive I think since we can afford rome, I’m leaning more to that
Feel like it would be more culturally different than what we’re used to
Wizard: I agree with you. Would you like me to book it for you?
User: Please book it
Wizard: Consider it done!
User: Thank you
