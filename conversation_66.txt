Wizard: Where would you all like to go?
User: I don't really have a preference for a destination, but I would like free breakfast. We would be leaving from Kingston for a vacation between August 19 and August 31.
Wizard: I've got a hotel in Toronto available with free breakfast between August 24 and August 30?
