User: Heyaaa
Wizard: Hi! How can I help you?
User: So  me and some coworkers need to take a little work trip from last Wednesday until last Saturday.
Wizard: Where would you like to go?
User: Sadly it is not a uniform decision... 14 of us wanna go Valencia
From Beijing
Wizard: So 14 adults altogether?
User: Yes, please
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: Nope
Wizard: There are no results. Is there somewhere else you'd like to go?
User: Could you send 6 adults to Vitoria?
Wizard: Unfortunately not.
User: Can you send one person literally anywhere from Beijing?
Wizard: 7 people or 15 people?
User: one
Wizard: Sorry, I thought you said one more. No I can't, there are no results within your requested dates.
