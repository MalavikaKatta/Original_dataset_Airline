User: Hi, I need to get to Melbourne from Fukuoka. unlimited budget and dates arent a concern and its just me travelling.
Wizard: Hi! Sounds like great trip but I'm sorry to inform you we don't offer any trips between Fukuoka and Melbourne. Any other places you'd like to go to?
User: I guess I’ll just go to Kochi and meet up with my homegirl Selena Gomez so we can chit chat about the…..weather.
Wizard: That sounds nice! I can bring you to Kochi for 6 days at a hotel in the heart of the city.
User: is it the best package you have? I want the best hotel.
Wizard: This is the only one available in Kochi.
User: ok i’ll take it. Whats the hotel like?
