Wizard: Where do you want to go?
User: Punta Cana is one of the option.
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: It'd be sweet to spend less than 3100
Wizard: When would you like to leave?
User: We can leave on or after Sep 2
Wizard: There's a 2.5 star hotel near the beach, the cost is 1661.32 and is from September 10th to 19th with business class flights.
User: Do you know the guest rating of this hotel?
Wizard: 0/10
User: That's not ideal. Do you have any other options for Punta Cana?
Wizard: This is our very best option.
User: I see. Can you check for trips to Phoenix then?
Wizard: We have a 3 star hotel near a museum and university, 6.91 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 9th to 19th, business class flights, price is 2967.70.
User: And that is also the best option you have?
