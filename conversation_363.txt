User: Hi there! I'm getting married in Phili next week and we are having the most beautiful wedding ever! With all the planning for the wedding, we forgot to plan our honeymoon! :airplane_departure: We are pretty broke but would still like to take a trip to Curitiba! :blush:
Wizard: Excellent, do you have any dates in mind?
User: We get married on September 1st, so we would like to leave on the 2nd :european_castle: A 15 day package would be ideal!
Wizard: How many people are going on this trip?
User: Just my husband and I, we are definitely leaving my new mother-in-law at home :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
Wizard: I'm pleased to tell you that we have a travel package available to Curitiba, departing Philadelphia on September 2 and returning on September 14. You would be staying at the renowned Crown Market Palace, a 3.5 star hotel with a guest rating of 8.22/10. The hotel is situated next to the beach, and features free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking. The total cost for this trip is $3460.88. Would you like to book this trip?
User: WOW that sounds amazing and it's under our budget of $3900! I love that it is on the beach :surfer: You found us the perfect honeymoon, thank you so much for your help.
