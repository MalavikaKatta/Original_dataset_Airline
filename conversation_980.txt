Wizard: We have a 3.0 star hotel near a park with 8.69/10 guest ratings, free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The trip is 18 days from today to the 19th. I can get you a seat in business class. Sound good?
User: Have you got any nicer hotels?
Wizard: Not really. There is another 3.0 star hotel with only 7.06/10 guest ratings. I don't think you would want that.
