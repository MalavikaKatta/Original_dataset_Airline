User: I would like to take my soon to be wife on a great honeymoon, she deserves the best but we can only afford something up to 4200 for 6 days. We had discussed going to Punta Cana from Sapporo where our wedding will take place on the 17th, we can leave after that.
Wizard: for 2 adults?
User: yeah lol we dont want a third wheel
Wizard: There are 2 hotel in Punta Cana that I can offer you - La Estrella del Mar and el Mar. La Estrella del Mar is an unrated hotel whereas the el Mar is rated 2.5 stars. Both offer 6 day packages for under your budget.  How do you feel about these choices?
User: What is the guest rating for the 2.5 star hotel?
Wizard: 0/10
User: oh. Well that’s okay. What is the hotel like?
Wizard: It's on the beach. Asides from that I don't have much information on it.
User: do they have wifi or anything?
Wizard: There is no information provided as to which amenities are included with this hotel.
User: okay. are there any at the 0 star hotel?
Wizard: No information provided for the one either. 
User: That’s okay I’ve heard only good things about Cuba plus everything is cheap there because everyone get’s paid a dollar a day. I think we will take the 2.5 star hotel . What are the dates for this package and the cost?
Wizard: The dates are from Sept 24th to 28th. The cost of this 6 day stay  is  3708.63USD if you want us to fly you there from Sapporo on business class.
User: Is there anything earlier?
Wizard: The unrated hotel La Estrella del Mar is available for the 18th
User: Thats perfect. since the hotels probably arent that much different anyway i will book this one. How much is this package?
Wizard: There are only economy class seats left in this flight and the total cost of the package is  3424.71USD for 2 adults
