User: What good is money if I can't spend it??? I have 5600 saved up, can't actually travel, but want to see where I could go if maybe things were different and I had time off work. Like for example
Would I be able to go from Ulsan to Washington?
Wizard: No.
User: Oh. Ulsan to..Paris?
Wizard: No.
User: Ok this isn't working out as intended. Do you fly from Ulsan to London?
Wizard: No
User: Ok. Last chance
Ulsan to Dublin
Wizard: We have a 2.5 star hotel for 2375.19 for economy and 3085.51 for business.
