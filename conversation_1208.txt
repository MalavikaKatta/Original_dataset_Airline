User: ay bruh i got 3300 and some naggy ass parental figures i need out of my hair. where can u get 2 adults from maceio between like ... september 11th and 24th within my budgeT?
Wizard: They can have 13 days in Santos or 12 days in Sao Paulo, Manaus, Buenos Aires, or Rosario.
User: tell me about the santos hotel
Wizard: It's a 3 star hotel with 8.37/10 previous guest ratings and it's next to shopping. Free breakfast and wifi is available during the stay.
User: not bad not bad. i would bank on that 8.37 as my sell point. for those other 12 packages - are any of them super cheap and swanky?
Wizard: Nothing cheaper and also better than the Santos option.
User: so Santos is the cheapest?? cheapest with a 3 star rating at least
Wizard: The 12 days in Buenos Aires is slightly cheaper at 1484.67. But the hotel only has a guest rating of 6.61/10.
User: but in Santos they would be gone from the 11-24 right?
Wizard: It's actually from the 12th to the 24th.
User: oh good enough. howmuch is that package
Wizard: 1528.79
User: book it please
Wizard: Alright, I've booked it for you! Your confirmation will arrive via email. Anything else for today?
