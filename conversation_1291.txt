User: Hi there, what is the best hotel in Toronto?
Wizard: You alone?
User: Yes
Wizard: Where are you coming from?
User: San Juan is where I reside.
Wizard: How long would you like to go to Toronto for?
User: As long as the 1800 dollars in my wallet can take me.
Wizard: Well then you're in luck! Because I can get you the 8 day package at the 4 star Hotel Eric Perrier, costing a total of 1668.81 for business class! How does that sound?
User: Nice! Is that the best hotel in Toronto?
Wizard: Yes it is the best. What do you think?
User: Can I get a longer package if I opt for economy flights?
Wizard: You can get a longer package if you opt for worse hotel. It's up to you.
User: Okay no it's got to be the best hotel. When does this trip depart?
Wizard: It leaves September 20th and returns September 27th. Does this entice you?
User: Could I get a longer stay or a better hotel with an additional $1000?
Wizard: No.
User: Okay at least I tried! I'll take the first offer!
Wizard: The 8 day package with the 4 star hotel? And business class?
User: Sure... might see some celebrities in business class :wink:
Wizard: Excellent choice. Your package has now been booked. Details will be sent to you shortly.
User: Fantastic!!
Wizard: You're welcome.
