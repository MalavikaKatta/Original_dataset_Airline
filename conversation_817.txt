User: Can you do flights for Kyoto for under 5000? This is for two people
Wizard: Depends on where you are coming from.
User: Just tell me whatâ€™s possible
Wizard: We've got flights from Ulsan, Kobe, Seoul, Busan, and Fukuoka. If you can tell me more about the dates you want to travel or what kind of hotels you are looking for, I can help you narrow down the choices.
User: But tell me if you can get a hotel near a park in Kyoto?
Wizard: We only have one hotel in Kyoto and it is in the heart of the city, close to a museum, but not necessarily close to a park.
