User: I would like a vacation for one in Mannheim from August 17 to September 7. My city of departure is Porto Alegre. It should cost less than $3000.
Wizard: I do not have a travel package to Mannheim from Porto Alegre for these travel dates.  I do however, have packages available from August 17th to the 29th.     Would these dates work for you?
User: How much would this package cost?
Wizard: I have two options.  The first option is a travel package which costs 2314.59 USD.  The second package costs 2981.83 USD.  Which one would you prefer?
User: If I increase my budget to $6000, does that open up any options from August 17 to September 7?
Wizard: I still have only two packages available from August 17th to September 7th.  Would you like to try a different travel destination?
User: What other destinations can you offer me with these dates?
Wizard: I have no other destinations available for these dates.  Would you like to change the start date or the end date?
