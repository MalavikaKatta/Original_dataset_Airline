User: Hi there, my friends and I would like to go to Belo Horizonte from Tofino for a couple days please.
Wizard: I canâ€™t offer anything out of Tofino unfortunately. Is there an alternate departure city I could try for you?
User: But all 9 of us will be coming from there!
Wizard: Can I look into something else for you?
User: No thank you.
