User: Hello, kind stranger.
Wizard: Would you like to go from Calgary to Vancouver?
User: I would like to go from Athens to Ulsan
Wizard: Ok! How many will be travelling?
User: I, my wife, and our infant son.
Wizard: Let me see what I can find :slightly_smiling_face: Do you have a budget?
User: Our budget is 6700. Not a penny more.
Wizard: I’m sorry, it seems I cannot accommodate a child on that budget. I can find you something if just two adults are travelling?
User: Burlington.
Wizard: I’m sorry, but I cannot get you from Athens to Burlington on 6700 dollars.
User: Then I will not be making use of your services.
Wizard: Sorry :disappointed:
