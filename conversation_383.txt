User: Hello. I'm just gonna be honest with you, here's my dilemma...I take pictures of people for a living of famous people. The more famous the more moolah I make.  Madonna is having a concert in Melbourne on August 24th and her new boyfriend Justin Bieber will be with her. Ya, I know that's a bit gross but that's the rumour. Can you get me there from Busan?? I need to leave on the 23rd.
Wizard: I'm sorry, we do not currently have any flights between Busan and Melbourne.
User: What?!?! Any flights to Melbourne from any other destinations?
Wizard: I can't help you there. Are there any other cities you are considering leaving from?
User: I could try to leave from Birmingham?
Wizard: I'm afraid we don't have flights connecting Birmingham and Melbourne either.
User: I will find another way to get there then, thank you anyways
Wizard: I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help to you.
