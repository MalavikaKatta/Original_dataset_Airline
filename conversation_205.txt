Wizard: would a 5 day trip suffice?
User: sure dude
Wizard: A 5 star hotel called the Regal Resort, it has free wifi and a spa
User: dates?
Wizard: Starts on august 27th until the 30th
User: ok that could work. I would like to see my options in Santos as well
Wizard: regal resort goes for $2800 or there is the Hotel Globetrotter in Santos it has 3 stars and comes with breakfast and wifi, It leaves on the 25th and returns on the 30th! all for $2000
