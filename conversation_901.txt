User: Where could I go if I had almost no money? I need to physically leave from Busan what if I came up with $400?
Wizard: You could go to Kobe, spend 17 days, and have 57 dollars left over.
User: Holy crap I'll take it!
Wizard: Would you like any more information?
User: 17 days in Kobe including flights for under $400? I'm gonna sound greedy now, but is breakfast included?
Wizard: No, sorry.
User: well can't have it all, save it for me anyways!
Wizard: Ok! Iâ€™ll send email confirmation as soon as its booked.
