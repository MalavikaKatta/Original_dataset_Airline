User: Hey! I have to book a trip for a group of people from Beijing to Toluca.
Wizard: How many people?
User: 14 of us
Wizard: All adults?
User: Right
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: I was hoping to spend maybe 2700.
Wizard: When would you like to leave?
User: We can go any day between Aug 29 and Sep 1
Wizard: There are no results within your budget or for these dates.
User: If I increase my budget by 200, would that change anything?
Wizard: No sorry.
User: What if I make my dates completely flexible?
Wizard: Still nothing.
User: I don't think this trip is going to work then..
