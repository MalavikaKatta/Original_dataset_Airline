User: Hi!!! I really need your help! I'm getting married in a week and with everything going on I haven't had time to book a honeymoon trip yet
Wizard: We  are here to help you with your request.  May I please have your city of departure and destination city?
User: We live in Montreal (JUST BOUGHT A HOUSE THERE!! haha so our budget is pretty tight right now). We were thinking of going to Cleveland but it would have to be for less than 1400
Wizard: What dates would you like to travel on and how long would you like your package to be?
User: Our wedding is August 31st so leaving September 2nd would be perfect. Any 8 day packages?
Wizard: Our earliest available package is on Sept 6 and is a 10 day package. Does that work for you?
User: My wife would really like us to leave as early as possible after the wedding... How much is it? And how many stars does the hotel have?
Wizard: It is the Pleasant Court Inn and it it actually also available for 5 and 7 day packages, but the earliest available date out of Montreal is Sept 6. This is a 3 star hotel near the park and theatre. any other destinations you would like me to check?
User: Are there any trips to Sydney that leave earlier? My wife has always wanted to go visit and it would be a nice surprise for her
Wizard: To Calgary I have the Lunar Resort  available. For under your budget, I only have a departure date of Sept 18 available with on a 4 day package. I also have it in a 7 day package with a departure date of Sept 5th, but it is over your budget at 1705.53USD.
User: That leaves way too late for us and we really can't go over budget :confused: Do you think my wife would mind if we only left September 6th?
Wizard: If you could depart on Sept 7, the Pleasant Court Inn in Cleveland has a special on a 7 day package for only  476.70USD.
User: She is really nervous about us spending too much so a sweet deal might make her happy. Plus then I can afford to take her to fancy restaurants  and to the theatre every night for a week haha. What have previous guests thought of this place?
Wizard: It has a guest rating of 8.98/10. This package includes free wifi, free parking and a free breakfast. It is located near a park and the theatre for your entertainment.  Would you like me to proceed with booking?
User: Wow thats super high! Ya, please book this for us, it would have been better to leave earlier but at this point this might be the best we can find
Wizard: would you like an upgrade to a business class flight? That package is 532.10USD and departs on the same day.
User: YES PLEASE! for that price, I can treat my beautiful bride to that
Wizard: I will take care of that booking for you. Thank you for booking!
User: Thank YOU!!
