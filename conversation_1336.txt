User: Hey, I'd like to bring my family on a trip to Kobe.
Wizard: Where are you coming from and how big is the family?
User: It would be 4 adults and 1 child. We'll be coming from Hiroshima.
Wizard: Before I give you my recommendations, is there a budget you'd like me to stay under?
User: 4400 is our goal budget. Can you find something good for us?
Wizard: We have a fantastic 4.5 star hotel: the Ivory Legacy Hotel. I can take your family there for 7 days in business class with your budget.
User: Wow that sounds amazing. How much would it cost us in the end? For both business and economy?
Wizard: 4130.75 for business and 3565.56 for economy.
User: It sounds great. I'll take it but I think I'd like economy please.
Wizard: Sure no problem! Your trip is booked for you from Sept 23-29 :slightly_smiling_face:
User: Perfect, thanks!
