Wizard: So 7 children and 1 adult? Do you have a budget?
User: yup and no budget.
Wizard: How many days would you like to go for? And do you have any dates in mind?
User: nothing in mind, we can go wheneveer
Wizard: I have a 14 day package and a 15 day package, is there one that interests you more?
User: 15
Wizard: Our 15 day package includes a hotel that offers free parking, breakfast, and wifi, and comes to a grand total of 12492.91 for economy and 16223.62 for business. Would you like to book this trip?
User: What is the hotel rated and what is the guest rating
Wizard: It's a 2.5 star hotel with a guest rating of 6.77/10. 2.5 star hotels are the most highly rated that we have in our packages from Santa Cruz to Dublin. Would you like me to proceed with booking for this trip?
User: Thats pretty pricey for a 2.5 star hotelâ€¦..Can you check the shortest trip available to Nagoya?
Wizard: We only have one package for Nagoya, and it's 15 days long. Are you interested?
User: ugh thats long. I think we will just go somewhere else to book. Thanks anyway tho.
