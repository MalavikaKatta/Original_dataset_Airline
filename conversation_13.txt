User: Hi im looking for a nice destination that i could go to from Columbus
Wizard: I have 2 choices, Vancouver or Toronto.
User: What options are there for both
Wizard: I have a few. Do you have a budget in mind?
User: $3700 is my budget at the moment
Wizard: I have the Obsidian Gem Inn in Vancouver which is a 4-star hotel at $1934.64 or the Hotel Richard in Toronto which is a 3-star hotel at $2393.00. Both are for a 14 day stay.
User: Toronto seems like a better place this time of year, when would the flights be?
Wizard: I have a direct flight to Toronto departing on August 15th and returning on August 28th.  Would you like me to book that for you?
User: would by chance have one leaving on the 19th
Wizard: I have a flight available departing on August 24th and returning on September 6th
User: letâ€™s go ahead and book this
Wizard: Perfect. Thank you.
