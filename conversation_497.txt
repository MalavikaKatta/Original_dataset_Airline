Wizard: Based on the information provided, I can provide you with 6, 8 and 12 day packages. Would you have any preference?
User: My wife was thinking of something about a week long so 6 or 8 would work
Wizard: I have several options. Are you looking for a specific star rating or location?
User: Not sure yet, my job is to find some options to comapre
Wizard: The Retro Inn is a 2 star rated hotel and is available in both the 6 day $6273.96USD and 8 day $7893.3USD packages. The Amusement is a 4 star rated hotel and is available only in a 6 day $4400.81USD package.

Wizard: The Retro Inn is near the airport and The Amusement is near the university.
User: ok, next place I thought of was Sendai
Wizard: I have the 4 star Hotel Kirei available for a 15 days stay only and it seems it is out of your budget.
User: Ya, and that's longer than what we wanted. My wife was really hoping Ulsan would work. Better luck there?
