User: Do you have any departures from Kobe, Japan?
Wizard: No, I don't.  Would you like to select another location?
User: How about Birmingham City?
Wizard: Sure.  Would you like to go to Mexico City?  I have a flight available on Wednesday, August 17th at 10:00 a.m. to Tuesday, August 23rd at 4:00 a.m.
User: What are my options for hotels?
Wizard: The best hotel I have is a 3.0 star hotel with a 6.91/10 rating.  The flight for this travel package would be from Monday, August 15th at 10:00 a.m. to Sunday, August 21st at 4:00 a.m.  The hotel has free parking and free wifi.  Would you like to book this travel package?

Wizard: The cost of this package is 1644.98 USD.  Would you like to book this travel package?
User: Could you show me some hotels with lower guest ratings and lower prices?
Wizard: Here are a couple of options.  The first option is a 3.0 star hotel (the Tropic), with a guest rating of 6.77/10 and a business class flight.  The cost is 1002.27 USD.  Or, if you prefer, you could choose the same 3.0 star hotel with a guest rating of 6.77/10 (the Tropic) and an economy flight,  for 812.69.
User: What other destinations could you offer me if I'm departing from Birmingham City?
Wizard: I could offer you Vancouver, British Columbia, or Porto Alegre, Brazil.  Which would you prefer?
User: How much are the packages to each city?
Wizard: Would you like a more expensive or a less expensive travel package?
User: I would like to see both options, along with the hotels offered
Wizard: I could offer you the package to Porto Alegre, Brazil for 2572.16 USD. The hotel would be the Deluxe Hotel (which has a guest rating of 8.69/10) or the package to Vancouver, British Columbia for 477.93 USD .  The hotel would be Parallel Carnaval Bed & Breakfast (which has a guest rating of 8.86/10).
User: I can extend my vacation time to the 14th of September, does this open up any new options?
Wizard: I have an even better option available for you.  You could travel to Vancouver, Canada for $511.80 USD.  You would stay at the Western Ridge.  It is a 4.0 star hotel with a 10/10 guest rating.  If, however, you would really like to travel to Mexico City, I have a great package for you at only 1168.35 USD.  You would stay at the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites.  It is a 3.5 star hotel with a 8.37/10 guest rating.  Which would you prefer?
