User: I need to get to Miami sometimes in the near future
Wizard: Where from?
User: Kyoto
Wizard: Sorry, we currently don't have any trips to Miami available. Can you settle for somewhere else?
User: ahh ok, I could do Tokyo. but if that's the case I wanna keep it under 3400 cause I could drive otherwise
Wizard: Unfortunately we also don't have any trips between these two cities right now.
User: Do you fly to Sacramento?
Wizard: We do that! And to make up for all the disappointments, I'd like to offer you a 5 star hotel in Sacramento with 10/10 guest ratings.
User: That's more like it
Wizard: Is your budget still 3400?
User: Can a colleague and I get there for 4200&gt;
Wizard: Unfortunately that budget won't work for the both of you.
