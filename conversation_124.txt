User: Hey there! My girlfriends and I are looking to go on a girlie trip for Spring Break. but we want to go somewhere wild like San Juan! 
Wizard: No problem, I've got you covered! How many will you be traveling with?
User: We'll be 4, these girls are like my best friends ever! We go to college in Indianapolis
Wizard: It looks like I have packages for 10 days in San Juan. I've also got a package for 5 days in San Francisco.
User: We can travel from August 24th to September 10th. we only have $6400 altogether! Plus we really have to have wifi, you need to make sure of that. Free breakfast would also be a necessity
Wizard: Both destinations fit within your budget, and both hotels offer both free wifi and free breakfast. The San Francisco package runs from the  27th to the 31st of August while the San Juan package runs from the 17th to the 26th. If you would like to compare prices, it is 2164.26USD for the San Juan package and 1955.23USD for the San Francisco package. 
User: How many stars for the hotel in San Francisco?
Wizard: You will be staying at Twin Canyon Inn, a 2-star hotel with a favorable 5.23/10 guest rating.
User: Do you have anything in San Juan leaving Indianapolis on August 24th? The 17th we still have an exam.
Wizard: Unfortunately the closest departure date I can give you would be the 26th of August. You will be staying at the Fairyland and returning on the 4th of September. This package costs 5678.60USD. However, I would recommend leaving on the 27th instead as this package is only 5236.20USD. Does either of these trips interest you?
User: You know, I think we'll stick to the SF one, it's just soooooo much cheaper and it will still be a party! Can you book us on that one?? The one at the Twin Canyon Inn, cant wait!
Wizard: Your trip has successfully been booked! Enjoy your vacation!
User: Thank youuuuuuuuuuu!
Wizard: You're very welcome! We hope to be of service again in the future!
