User: Hello there! Looking to get away between August 27th and August 30th! Can you help me?
Wizard: Do you have a destination in mind?
User: Not at the moment, but i am from Mexico City
Wizard: I have several packages to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic available. How flexible are you with your dates?
User: Im thinking as long as we end before August 31st. What are the packages like in Punta Cana?
Wizard: Unfortunately I do not have any packages ending before August 31st. However I can offer you two packages which end on the 31st of August. Both feature a stay in La Estrella del Mar,  a 0.0 star hotel with a 0/10 guest rating. However you have the choice between flying business and economy, bringing your total to 292.21USD or 219.58USD, respectively.
User: 0 stars seems attracting! I think i will fly Economy for this cheap trip!
Wizard: Wonderful, your trip has been booked!
User: amazing! thanks!
