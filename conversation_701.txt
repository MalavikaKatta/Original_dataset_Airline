User: Hi there, I want to take my two grandchildren for a little holiday. We are living in Phili and they finish their camp on September 11 so we can leave anytime afterwards.
We have to be back by September 22 so they can go to school on the 23.
Wizard: Will that be just one adult and 2 kids?
User: You are right!
Wizard: do you have a destination in mind?
User: Mexico City would be ideal.
Wizard: How much would you like to spend?
User: That's no issue, I'd spend anything for a good time with my grandkids!
Wizard: We don't fly from Philadelphia to Mexico City. Anywhere else?
User: What about Vancouver?
Wizard: In Vancouver, we have the lovely Obsidian Gem Inn on a 6 day stay. It is rated 4 stars, is located near a park and includes free parking, wifi and your breakfast. This package deal is worth  2538.96USD and will get you back before school starts on Sept 16.
User: And it leaves on the 11?
Wizard: correct
User: Would you by any chance have any trips to Denver too?
Wizard: I have 4, 5 and 6 day trips available. Would you like to be near the park or the university?
User: Definitely the park. 6 day trip would be nice
Wizard: I have the Brass Renaissance Resort, 3 star, near a park, includes breakfast and wifi at 2351.83USD. I also have the Solar Inn, 3 star, not sure about the location, includes only wifi at 1956.7USD.
User: Do you know the guest ratings of these two hotels?
Wizard: The Brass Renaissance Resort is 8.86 / 10 and the Solar is 8.69 / 10.
User: And for the Vancouver one?
Wizard: The guest rating is 8.8 / 10
User: Thanks for looking! I think I will still prefer the Vancouver package. Can you book it for us with business seats?
Wizard: Sure can! Booked on business class for a total of 3023.31USD.
User: thankyou
