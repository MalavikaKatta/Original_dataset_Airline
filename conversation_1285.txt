User: I sure hope! I want to go to Santo Domingo!
Wizard: You and who else?
User: No one else!
Wizard: Where from?
User: I could leave from Ciudad Juarez.
Wizard: I'm afraid there are no trips from Ciudad Juarez to  Santo Domingo. Would it be possible for you to leave from somewhere else?
User: Actually yeah I could leave from Kochi.
Wizard: Unfortunately there are no flights from Kochi either. Is there another city of departure that you would like to suggest?
User: How about let's try going to Busan then? From Ciudad Juarez is possible?
Wizard: Yes, do you need to adhere to a time frame?
User: I hope to travel between Sept 8-17. But I'm willing to make it flexible to find a food trip.
Wizard: We have one beautiful package for you from Ciudad Juarez to Busan that is 6 days long. The stay would be at a 3 star hotel that includes free parking, breakfast, and wifi. Does this interest you?
User: Can I ask you whether it's possible to find a better hotel if I depart from Kochi?
Wizard: Same hotel I'm afraid.
User: Are there longer trips then?
Wizard: From Ciudad Juarez or Kochi?
User: Either, which one offers the longer stay in Busan?
