User: My friends and I would love to get to Phoenix please!
Wizard: Where will you be coming from? And how many friends?
User: It'll be 3 of us from Tofino.
Wizard: Sorry, we currently don't have any trips leaving from Tofino. Any chance you can leave from another city?
User: Oh really? I guess we can leave from Beijing then.
Wizard: Unfortunately we also don't serve trips out of Beijing. Would you have another alternative?
User: We can leave from Beijing though, right?
Wizard: Unfortunately no. We don't serve flights out of Beijing. Would you be able to leave from somewhere else?
User: I guess I'll have to go elsewhere to book our trip
Wizard: Sorry I was not able to help!
User: That's fine, we'll look somewhere else. Bye.
