User: Hey how are you?
Wizard: I am well, how may I help you today?
User: I want to go visit some relatives in Tampa, but they don't have room to host me so I am looking for a flight and hotel combo package. I would be free to travel between September 6th to 24th
Wizard: What is your city of departure?
User: I'm sorry I wrote that too fast, I meant to say that I am leaving FROM Tampa and visiting family in Munich
Wizard: I have hotel stays in 5 day and 7 day lengths, which one do you prefer?
User: How much are they? My budget is 3600
Wizard: Both are available for under that amount. Anything special you would like for your hotel in Munich?
User: Not really, I won't be spending much time there so it doesn't have to be anything fancy. Can you tell me more about the 7 day stay?
Wizard: The Regal Bluff is a five star hotel located near the university. It offers free wifi and costs $2269.58USD. It is open at the moment from Sept 10th to the 15th.
User: Would you have an even cheaper package to offer me if my dates were flexible?
Wizard: In Munich all the hotels that are open at the moment are 5 star rated hotels. This hotel is also available for 2157.43USD for 5 days from Sept 6 to Sept 9.
User: get me the 7 day one
Wizard: Very well, we shall proceed with the reservation
User: Can you just confirm which one you are booking for me? You seem confused
