Wizard: Where to?
User: Anywhere! Just get us out of Cleveland!
Wizard: How many people?
User: 14 total, can you believe it?
Wizard: All adults?
User: nope 7 adults
Wizard: When would you like to leave?
User: Sept 12 and we all need to be back by the 1st
Wizard: Our best package is 12 days in SL at a 3 star hotel from the 14th to 30th. The hotel is close to the airport and beach, they have a 6.91/10 guest rating and offer free breakfast and wifi. The cost for business is 9043.35 and for economy is 7573.39.
User: Not big on SL...got anything else?
Wizard: New York, San Antonio, Dublin, Indianapolis, and Fort Lauderdale.
User: What can you give us in Indianapolis?
Wizard: 2.5 stars, beach, shopping, 6.37/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, wifi, 13th to 29th, 7983.43 for economy, and 9596.90 for business.
User: Not great...Fort Lauderdale?
Wizard: 2 star hotel near market, 8.22/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast and wifi, 14th to 29th, 10656.19, economy.
User: Nice guest rating but 2 star is just way too low, plus it's more expensive. SL makes more sense. Is it $7573.39 for all 14 of us?
Wizard: yes.
User: Can you give me the departure time please so i can let everyone know?
Wizard: 3 pm for departure.
User: Those times are reasonable with kids. I guess I will reserve that one. What do you need from me?
Wizard: You will receive a confirmation email soon where you can give us information and payment. Have a great trip!
User: Fantastic. Thanks a bunch!
Wizard: No problem!
