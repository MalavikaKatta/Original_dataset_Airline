Wizard: Hello, how can I help you today? :smile:
User: Where can I go from Salvador for free
Wizard: I am sorry, No results found.
User: What!! Ok how about $400 Can I get anywhere on that budget
Wizard: Yes, to Rio de Janeiro or Manaus
User: No way! What kind of hotel should I expect in Rio de Janeiro?
Wizard: We have a 3 stars hotel for 384.32, 7 days
