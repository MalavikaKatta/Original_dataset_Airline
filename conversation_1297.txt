User: Recife to Pittsburgh for 4 adults. Only 5 star hotels
Wizard: I only have 2.5 star rated hotels in Pittsburgh
User: Check Fukuoka then
Wizard: In Fukuoka, my search only turns up 3.5 star rated hotels
User: Vancouver?
Wizard: I don't have any 5 star rated hotels there either but I do have the Western Ridge with a rating of 4 and a perfect guest rating of 10/10.
User: yeah but the hotel isn't 5 stars. You should try harder to find me a 5 star hotel, it's my birthday!
Wizard: Unfortunately, we do not have any 5 star rated hotels available in any of those cities at this time
