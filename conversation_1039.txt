User: Hi. I'm just here at work.... stuck at the old computer desk
Stuck dreaming about a better place than this one
I have been wanting to get out of Santa Cruz for ages now
But I never have any vacation days..
Wizard: Okay, where would you want to go?
User: I really wanna go to Minneapolis
Wizard: Would you have a budget?
User: Yeah.. I have 3100 in my savings account.
Wizard: Unfortunately there are no results for this within your budget. Do you have a second destination you were wondering about?
User: Would I able to get to Kobe maybe?
Wizard: Again, not within your budget.
User: Hiroshima???
Wizard: Nothing available within your budget, sadly.
