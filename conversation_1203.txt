User: Is it possible to get from Alexandria to Fukuoka for 3200
Wizard: Will you be travelling on your own?
User: No - there will be two adults and one child in total.
Wizard: I'm afraid it's not possible with that budget of yours.
User: Surely you can get us to Indianapolis.
Wizard: I sure can! What about a 14 day package at Hotel Vanilla for just 1914.82 for the whole family?
User: Great price for a two week stay! What’s the hotel like though?
Wizard: There is free parking, free breakfast and free wifi! It's also by a park, beach, airport, and university so there are plenty of activities for your family to get involved in!
User: Lovely - beachside is ideal for the young one. May I ask what the rating is?
Wizard: The guest rating is 7.15 out of 10. Want to purchase this trip?
User: What is the official rating though&gt;
Wizard: 3 stars. It's the best we have.
User: That’s fine ; I am but a mere writer after all. And the length of stay certainly trumps the quality of residence. Please book it.
Wizard: Perfect! I'ts been booked! Enjoy your stay :slightly_smiling_face:
User: Thank you kindly.
