Wizard: How many people are you?
User: I'm traveling solo
Wizard: When do you want to leave?
User: I don't really care. My budget is 4400 though. Surprise me.
Wizard: There are no results, surprise!
User: Okay maybe I don't like surprises that much after all... How about Cairo?
Wizard: There's a 2.5 star hotel.
User: Anything else?
