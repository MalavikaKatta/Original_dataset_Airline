User: Hi there! I'm about to jet out to my first ever internship
I need to make sure I get this booking exactly right
Can you get me to Rome?
Wizard: I can! Where are you leaving from?
User: That would be Santiago
Wizard: What is your budget?
User: Nothing more than 1700 please
Wizard: When do you need to be there?
User: As long as possible, between September 8 and September 25 (of this year)
Wizard: There are no flights to Rome after the 8th.
User: That's strange. What about flights to Fortaleza then?
Wizard: There are no results for this either within your budget.
User: This is alarming! How about lets try Sao Paulo
Wizard: There are no results for your date range.
