User: Hi, I need to go somewhere warm!
Wizard:  Where would you like to leave from?
User: Columbus, it's much colder here than people think.
Wizard: Oh, ok! When would you like to travel?
User: Ideally, I need to leave this Thursday the 25
Wizard: Ok! And did you have any particular location in mind?
User: Not really, just warm, beach and sunshine. I have $3400.00 to spend.
Wizard: Alright, and do you have a return date in mind?
User: Yes I must be back for my sister's wedding on 12 September, I'm the maid of honour. She will kill me if I'm not back on time. I really need to get a tan before the wedding though!
Wizard: Ok! I have something in mind for you. Would you be interested in Monterrey, Mexico? I can book you a 4.0 star hotel on the beach for 1057.88! You would leave August 27 and return home on September 7
User: That sounds so perfect! What is included in that package? I do not like to pay for my breakfast!
Wizard: Youâ€™re in luck! Free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking are all included in the package!
User: Book it!
Wizard: Sure thing :slightly_smiling_face: Thank you for using my services today.
