User: Hi. I am leaving from Recife
Trying to see if there are any 5 star hotels in Sendai
Wizard: Would a 4 star suffice?
User: Barely, but tell me more
Wizard: Well there’s the Hotel Kirei, near a park and a museum with a 8.8/10 guest rating. I also have vacancies at the Voyage which features a 8.49/10 guest rating and is near both museums and shopping.
User: Is there free breakfast at the Kirei?
Wizard: No, sorry. Only free wifi at both of these hotels.
User: Ok I’ll roll the dice. But yes let me know the dates I can get at Kirei
Keep in mind I need to back before the 8th of September, preferably
Wizard: I can book you from Sept 2-7
User: Done, done, done.
Wizard: Business class?
User: Yes
Wizard: That will be 7185.50USD.
User: Yes I will wire the money over shortly. Is this booked?
Wizard: It sure is!
