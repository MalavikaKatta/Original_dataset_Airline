User: Hi there, I'm looking to book a trip to Manaus. Do you think you can help me find the best deal?
Wizard: Sure can! Where are you hailing from?
User: My family and I will be coming from Leon.
Wizard: And how big is the family?
User: I'll just be going with my wife and son.
Wizard: Do you have a budget range?
User: Yeah actually, I do. I have absolutely no plans of spending beyond 2900.
Wizard: Unfortunately that budget won't work. Do you have any other cities you would like to visit?
User: Are you sure about this? Not even for just a few days?
Wizard: Unfortunately not for Manaus. did you have any alternatives?
User: No i'm afraid not!
Wizard: I'm sorry I will not be able to help then. Good luck with your search!
User: Thank you.
