User: I want to go to Barcelona from anywhere between the 12th and the 28th of September. I have 2100 and my assistant will be coming along. I am specifically looking for hotels near a park or beach or both.
Wizard: I have 2 different hotels available in Barcelona but the Nova Resort is the only one located near a park. How long would you like to stay in Barcelona?
User: I'm not picky, i'm travelling for work. What is the hotel near the park like?
Wizard: It is in the downtown area close to a park and the university, it has 3 star rating witn an excellent guest rating of 9.16 om 5 and has wifi included along with parking. The price for a 10 day package is  1453.6USD, but it is also available for 9 days at 1725.59USD on a different date.
User: Not bad at all. Are there any hotels near a park in SL?
Wizard: The only hotel I have available in St. Louis is the Chateau Inn & Suites , which is not near a park but is close to the beach.  This is a 15 day package and if you can leave from La Paz,  then the price is 1350.52USD
User: hmm very tempting. Anything in San Juan?
Wizard: Yes but nothing near a park or beach
User: Okay then that is out of the question. I think I will go to Barcelona for the 9 day package. When does it leave?

User: good. the price is 1725.59 right?
