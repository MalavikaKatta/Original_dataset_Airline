User: Hey there, I need to book a trip to get away!
Wizard: Ok! Where?
User: I'm thinking about taking my family to Denver.
Wizard: How many of you would be travelling?
User: I'll just be me, my wife, and our son.
Wizard: Ok. Where are you leaving from?
User: Fukuoka.
Wizard: And have you got a travel budget?
User: I don't want to spend any more than 4900.
Wizard: Unfortunately I cannot get you all to Denver for that price. Any other destinations to explore?
User: Oh that's too bad. My son was looking forward to it.
But yeah we can try somewhere else.
Wizard: Where?
User: How about Nagoya?
Wizard: I can do that. I have the 3 star Oceanside Resort available for 9 days from September 12th to 20th. You would be staying near a university and have access to free parking, complimentary breakfast, and unlimited wifi usage. The total for your family of 3 would be 1554.40 USD.
User: Do you happen to have any six day packages?
Wizard: Sorry, this is the only package I have for Nagoya.
User: You know what, I'll take it. It's within my budget after all.
Wizard: Great! I can upgrade you to business class flights at a total cost of 1723.51USD if you would like.
User: Thanks for the offer, but I don't really need it. I'm good with economy class!
Wizard: Ok, I will proceed with the economy class booking.
User: Excellent, thank you.
Wizard: You are oh so very welcome
