User: Hi
Wizard: Okay. So where would you like to go and where are you leaving from?
User: Well, I need to find a place where the paparazzi won't find me. I was thinking of Phoenix. Madonna and I are leaving from Cairo.
Wizard: Do you have dates in mind?
User: Yes, well, I'd like to leave as soon as possible, but I need to be back by September 7.
Wizard: The best I can offer for Phoenix is a 3 star hotel, offers free breakfast, wifi, and parking. The price for this package is 1767.71.
User: I will only look at 5 star hotels.
Wizard: I'm sorry but there are no 5 star hotels for these two destinations. Is there somewhere else you would be willing to go?
User: Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.
Wizard: The best I can offer is a 2.5 star hotel.
User: I refuse to stay in anything under 4 stars.
Wizard: Everything available is under 4 stars. I apologize.
User: Good day.
