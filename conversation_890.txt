User: Hi there! I have 3800 to spend
I live in Milan
Would i be able to get to Philadelphia?
Wizard: Sure can! You can go for as long as 11 days.
User: Would it be at an upscale hotel?
Wizard: I wouldn't say so. It's a 2 star hotel, although it has 6.61/10 average client rating.
User: Alright. Lets try another place: Kocchi
Wizard: That's not a bad choice! With your money you can stay 8 days at a 3.5 star hotel and 12 days at a 2.5 star hotel.
User: Is the 3.5 star hotel near anything of note?
Wizard: Are you kidding? It's in the heart of the city and next to a park!
User: Why would I be kidding? I did not expect to come here and get insulted by a bot. ok you know what
indianapolis also seems like itâ€™d be cool
Wizard: It is very cool! With you budget you can go there for 10 days in a 2.5 star hotel.
User: 2.5 stars? how are the guest ratings then?
Wizard: Not bad. It's rated 6.37/10 on average.
User: Thats it for today, thank you
Wizard: You're welcome! Have a nice trip back to real life!
