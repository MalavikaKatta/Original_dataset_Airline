Wizard: We have a great range of offerings for you. Could you tell me a bit more about your desired travel dates and budget so I can narrow down the choices?
User: I'd like to travel sometime between Wednesday September 7 and Saturday September 17. My budget is flexible but something affordable would be great.
Wizard: Sounds good! We offer 10 day trips at a 3.5 star hotel and 5 or 6 day trips at a 3.0 star hotel. Would you like to know more about these options?
