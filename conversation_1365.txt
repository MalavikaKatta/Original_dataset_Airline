User: Hi I've got 9 days free and I'm looking for a vacation. I live in San Francisco.
Wizard: Absolutely! Where do you want to go and when do you want to go there?
User: No, dates or places in mind. Was hoping you could help me. Something as cheap as possible.
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: Just something crazy cheap.
Wizard: I have 9 days at the Cosmos Inn in Kingston for $2764.
User: That's not crazy cheap
Wizard: I can't accomodate your request
User: what's the cheapest you got?
Wizard: The cheapest package I can see at this point is to Mexico City for 1061.36USD.
User: How about a budget of $400?
Wizard: I have one trip under 400 - 7 days at the Crown Jungle Inn in Columbus for 399.8USD.
User: Yes let's go with that!
Wizard: Ok! I will go ahead and book it for you. Would you like further information first?
User: No, it sounds good. I'll take it.
Wizard: Ok, consider it booked! Please watch for confirmation
User: Thanks!
