User: I am one person voyaging to Tampa. I can depart from Indianapolis. Must be between 20th and 31 August.
Wizard: Do you have a budget for this travel package?
User: No, and I have expensive taste
Wizard: Between the 20th and 31st of August, I have only travel packages to Vancouver, Canada.  You would leave on August 27th and return on August 30th.  I have one travel package at $3515.84, which would be five days at the Obsidian Gem Inn.
User: On second thought, I would like to go to Busan.
Wizard: I just checked and it is not possible to travel to Busan from Indianapolis.  Would you like to depart from Calgary, Canada or Queenstown, New Zealand?
User: Would I be allowed to got with me and four colleagues?
Wizard: Are they all adults?
User: Nevermind, I would like to depart from Queenstown
