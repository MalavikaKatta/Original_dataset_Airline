User: Hi, me and my family want to take a trip to Kakariko Village.
Wizard: How many adults and how many children will you be bringing with you?   Do you have a preferred departure location?  What would be your maximum budget?
User: We are four adults and 11 children departing from Godric's Hollow. $3500 is the most we are willing to spend.
Wizard: I do not have any packages available from that departure location for that budget.  Would you like to adjust the budget?
User: I would not be able to spend more than $4500
Wizard: Would you like to suggest another departure location?  And what travel destination would you like to travel to?
User: We'll catch a flight from Toronto then. We're headed for Kakariko Village.
Wizard: There are no travel packages available to Kakariko Village.
