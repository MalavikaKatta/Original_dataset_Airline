User: Hi! I hear Hogsmeade has some excellent bars. Can you book me a trip there from Diagon Alley, leaving on August 13th? For 7 men and women
Wizard: Hi there! I am searching trips available to Hogsmeade but am unable to find any possibilities. Is there another destination you might be interested in?
User: Well, we were thinking Dominican Republic could be fun as well.
Wizard: Ok. I will look for trips to Dominican Republic. Do you have another option for a departure city?
User: Yes, Vancouver.
Wizard: Great! Where would you like to travel to?
User: Punta Cana is good!
Wizard: Great. I can book a trip for 7 people travelling from Vancouver to Punta Cana for 3853.27USD.
User: that's just a little over my budget... what about for 3 adults instead of 7?
Wizard: For three adults, this trip would cost 1651.40USD.
User: The trip meant to be a bachelor party for my friend. is there an open bar at the hotel?
Wizard: I do not have this information for the El Mar hotel in Punta Cana.
User: How many stars is it?
Wizard: 2.5 stars.
User: Let's try 4 stars.
Wizard: I'm having trouble finding 4 star hotels in Punta Cana for you. Perhaps if you provided a departure and/or return date I could narrow things down?
User: End of August, anytime after the 22nd of August.
Wizard: I am only able to find hotels with a 2.5 star rating in Punta Cana for that time. 
User: 2.5 stars will do. Can you offer any additional activities?
Wizard: Unfortunately I am not able to provide this information.
User: How about breakfast?
Wizard: El Mar does not provide breakfast.
User: Are there other hotels in the area that do?
Wizard: I am unable to find other hotels in Punta Cana that offer free breakfast.
User: In that case I will book the first one for 1651. 40 USD.
Wizard: Great! You will leave Vancouver at 10:00 am - Wednesday, August 24th.

Wizard: You will leave Vancouver at 10:00 am - Wednesday, August 24th.
