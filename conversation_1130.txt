User: I wanna go to Guadalajara from Fort Lauderdale with 1 of my pals
Wizard: Do you have a preference for when you would like to travel?
User: preferably between september 6th and 18th
Wizard: I have a couple of places. Are you searching for hotels with higher ratings or do you prefer to choose a place by location?
User: I'm looking for high ratings but i'd like to hear about location as well, just in case
Wizard: My highest rated hotel in Guadalajara is the Excursion Inn, a 3 star hotel with a 8.37 /10 guest rating, located near the airport and close to a park. This hotel is available on a 5 day and 9 day package.
User: Nice! Can you find a package to Frankfurt? I can leave from Fort Lauderdale.
Wizard: I sure can. I have the excellent 5 star rated hotel the Atlantis Peaks Resort available for a 10 day stay, which provides you with complimentary breakfast and wifi service and has en excellent guest rating of 9.32/10.
User: Oh wow! that's awesome! Out of curiosity is there anything from Alexandria to Guadalajara?
Wizard: Yes but it's the same hotel as previously discussed, the  Excursion Inn
User: Okay well then I think i'd like to book the package from Fort Lauderdale to Frankfurt. Do they offer business flights?
Wizard: Yes business class is available on this package at a cost of 5168.69USD. Should I get that all booked up for you
