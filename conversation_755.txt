User: Hi there. Iâ€™d like to book a trip for 10 adults from August 29 to Sept 1, from Tofino to Vancouver
Wizard: I am sorry, I cannot offer you anything from Tofino to Vancouver within those dates. Are your dates flexible? May I check other destinations for you?
User: Dates are not flexible, but check for flights to Nagoya
Wizard: No flights from Tofino to Nagoya either
User: do you have flights from tofino to anywhere?
Wizard: Seems that Tofino is not serviced by any of our airlines
