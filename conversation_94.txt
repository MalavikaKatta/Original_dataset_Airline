User: Hi! I'd like to plan my honeymoon, but I've spent way too much on my wedding and need to stick to a budget of $4600. Can you offer anything to Marseille for 5 days leaving from Salvador on August 17?
Wizard: I dont have anything for your budget or start date
User: I'm afraid that I really need to stick to my budget. Can you look up packages for Rome?
Wizard: I have the perfect package for you! It is at the Secret Bay in Rome, with a flight leaving on the 17th and returning on the 20th, The total cost on this package is $4517.97USD.
User: That is excellent. The hotel is how many stars? Is there a spa?
Wizard: It is a 0 star hotel but it includes free breakfast and wifi. Unfortunately, it does not have a spa.
User: Holy moly! That is not a good way to start a marriage! Do you have any other packages?
Wizard: Not in Rome.  Do you want me to look at other destinations?
User: Let's go back to the Marseille deals, and I will reconsider my budget and dates.
Wizard: The most economical deal we have at the moment in Marseille from Salvador is  $5203.99USD in a 4 star hotel which includes free wifi. It is available from August 21st to August 24th.
User: Great, I'd like to book this one please!
Wizard: Perfect, I will take down all your details and send you the confirmation. Enjoy your stay in Marseille!
User: Thank you!
