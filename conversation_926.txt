User: Hi there
Wizard: Hello, ready to discover your perfect trip?
User: I have 6500 to spend on my parents. Want to get them out of Santo Domingo
Tomorrow to the 19th
Any destinations offer such a possibility
Wizard: My best package is a 16 day stay at a 5 star Berlin hotel. It's rated 8.86/10 and offers free wifi and breakfast.
User: That isâ€¦amazing. This is for two adults and under 6500?
Wizard: Yup, it will only be 6276.61 if they can fly economy.
User: I was going to review my options But I will be impulsive and seize this opportunity
Wizard: I think that's a very smart choice. Would you like me to confirm the booking for you?
User: Please
Wizard: Done! I wish your parents a pleasant trip!
User: Thank you!
