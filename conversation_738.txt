User: so, hello there..
Wizard: Hello to you also
User: I need a getaway to do some writing looking to leave seattle
what can you give me in burlington for 2 adults and one kid
Wizard: Date of departure?
User: doesn’t matter, just looking to spend around 9 days
Wizard: We have a few options for you. Do you have a certain amount of money to allocate to this trip?
User: that’s the thing… I only made about 1200 on my last book
Wizard: $1200 will not cover any of our 9 day packages in Burlington, perhaps we can lower the amount of days?
User: ah, yeah sure.. first can you see if it would buy 9 days in Phoenix?
Wizard: No there is nothing available in Phoenix for that rate at all.
User: oh dear.. ok well just see if there’s anything in Burlington for a lower date range
Wizard: The lowest I have in Burlington is 2056.86USD, on a 9 day package. Are you able to raise your budget a bit?
User: you know what, frig it.. yeah lets do it
Wizard: would you like some more details before we proceed with the booking?
User: well is this the only package within this price range?
Wizard: yes
User: in that case, just book it,, I’m just happy to get away and clear my head
Wizard: I will proceed with the booking and send you all the details.
User: great. thank you!
