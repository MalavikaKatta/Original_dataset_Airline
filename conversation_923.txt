User: I have 0 budget. But big dreams
I’m heading out from Tampa
Going to Campinas
But I’m ok with any destination really
Wizard: I'm afraid I cannot help you here.
User: Ok that was a stretch. Just trying to see if you would glitch and give me a freebie
But for real, where can I go with 400$?
Wizard: Now that's better! I can take you to Punta Cana or Atlanta with that.
User: It would be nice to get out of the country! What hotel could you find me in Punta Cana?
Wizard: You can have a 14 day trip to Punta Cana at a 2.5 star beachside hotel for 167.60 if you fly economy.
User: That is a bargain and a half. Does the hotel also serve free breakfast?
Wizard: No, it is void of any amenities. But who needs those when you've got the beach?
User: WHY SEE THE WORLD, WHEN YOU’VE GOT THE BEACH?? you speak wise words
sign me up
Wizard: Your trip is booked for you
User: That is all, my friend
