two adults travelling, of course, and we want to go to Kingston for 9 days. What can you give me?

Wizard: I have a package on a 12 night stay at the Cosmos Inn. This hotel is in the downtown area of Kingston but also near a park. It has a 2.5 star rating and includes breakfast, free wifi and a parking space.
User: What’s the guest rating? more appealing?
Wizard: 6.37/10.  If you prefer something with a higher rating, we can look at shortening your stay and placing you in a nicer hotel. Is this something you may consider?
