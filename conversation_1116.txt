User: Yeah, I'm looking for an 8 day trip for the family.
Wizard: How many are in your party?
User: Two and a kid.
Wizard: Where would you like to go and where would you like to leave from?
User: I've got two places in mind. I'll be coming from Buenos Aires and I'm thinking about going to Santo Domingo.
Wizard: You are travelling alone?
User: No, sorry. I meant all of us.
Wizard: How much money do you have to spend?
User: I'm on a tight budget here, so not more than 4300
Wizard: And when would you like to leave?
User: Anytime soon is good.
Wizard: Then I have nothing to offer you.
User: Let's try somewhere else then.
Wizard: I only have availability in Santo Domingo for 2 adults at your price point.
User: Fine, what about a trip to Burlington then? One that involves my son of course.
Wizard: Iâ€™m sorry - I have nothing within your budget. Would you like to explore other destinations? Perhaps something within your country would be within your budget.
User: Bye.
Wizard: Good bye .
