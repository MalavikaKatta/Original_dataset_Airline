User: I'm looking to book a trip from Hamburg starting August 15th. I have a 14 day vacation. What packages can you recommend?
Wizard: Hi there! From where will you be leaving?
User: Hamburg
Wizard: Will you be travelling with a companion, and is there a budget for this trip?
User: No and no.
Wizard: I have packages available to Manaus, Denver, Ciudad Juarez and South Korea. Do any of these places interest you?
User: Can I get more information for Manaus?
Wizard: The package includes a 10 day stay in a 2.5 star hotel and economy flights with a departure on August 19th.
User: Do you have information for Denver?
Wizard: The Denver package has a 9 day stay in a 3 star hotel with business class flights and a departure on August 15th.
