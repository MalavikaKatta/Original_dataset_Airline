User: Any week long trips to Brasilia from Mannheim between august 30 and september 15?
Wizard: I have 6 days at the Sublime Tower from Sept 8-12. Would you like to hear more?
User: Does it cost less than 3500?
Wizard: 2678.5USD for economy flights, 3436.17USD for business class.
User: Great its under my budget so please tell me more!
Wizard: Sure! The hotel is 3.5 officially but has a 8.69 guest rating, its near the beach, shopping, and a theatre, and features free wifi, parking, and breakfast.
User: Sounds like a good place to stay! I'm also considering Curitiba
Wizard: I have multiple packages in Curitiba for 14, 15, or 9 days.
User: As long as they fit my budget and my dates, please tell me about them all
Wizard: All packages are less than 3500 dollars. You can stay at the Crown Market Palace on the beach, a 3.5 star with all amenities listed above; Pinnacle, a 3.0 star hotel near a museum and market also featuring all amenities; or the Dual Basin Residence, one again featuring all previously listed amenities, and located on the beach near a shopping mall and market.
User: What do you mean by all amenities listed above?
Wizard: Free wifi, breakfast, and parking.
User: ok thanks! Pinnacle is the 15 day one right?
Wizard: There are 15 day packages available at Market Palace or Pinnacle. You may also stay at Pinnacle for 9 days if that suits you better.
User: I would prefer to stay at Market since it is by the beach and a longer stay is more that fine with me if I can afford it haha. What are the dates for that one?
Wizard: September 2-15
User: That would be perfect! That's my favorite one so far :slightly_smiling_face: How much is it?
Wizard: 2589.23USD or I could upgrade you to business class flights for a total of 3326.96USD
User: Fantastic, I would prefer to go with economy. Last place I could go to is Fortaleza
Wizard: great :slightly_smiling_face: Shall I book that now?
User: I would still like to compare that package with your options in Fortaleza
Wizard: Within your budget and date range I have Elder Angel from Sept 8 - 14, a 3 star hotel near a mall with free wifi, breakfast, and parking; I also have this hotel available from Sept 2-6 for around 2900 dollars (the 8-14 would cost 2100). Additionally, the Riverside 3.0 star hotel is available from Sept 2-6 for just under 3000 dollars. This hotel has free wifi, breakfast, and parking and is located near a park and a museum. The final option would be Private Hotel from Sept 6-10. Private Hotel has a 3.0 star rating, is located near a mall, and includes complimentary breakfast, free wifi, and free parking.
User: I think Market Palace is still my favorite one, did it have good reviews?
Wizard: User reviews are 8.22/10 for the Market Palace.
User: Ok good to know, I'll go with that one then!
