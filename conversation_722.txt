User: Hello! I'm booking for a honeymoon right after our wedding in Monterrey.
We can leave any day after September 6.
Wizard: Where do you want to go?
User: Ideally Ulsan for 5 days.
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: 4400 tops... spent too much on the wedding already :disappointed:
Wizard: There is nothing available within your budget
User: Nothing?? That's unfortunate. I guess we can also settle for Rome.
Wizard: There is still nothing available.
User: Oh man.. that really sucks.
Wizard: Okay. Have a nice day!
