User: so have you given me all the options available from ulsan to burlington between august 27-sept 10
Wizard: Unfortunately I cannot change your dates as all available packages are for the 27th to the 31st of August. I can offer to upgrade your flight to business class, or book you at the Excursion Motel instead of the Noble Bazaar Resort, however these packages will all cost you more than the one I have already described.
