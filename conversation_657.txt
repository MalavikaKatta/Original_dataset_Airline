User: Hi, can you help me book a trip with my assistant? We are only free between Aug 30 and Sep 7
Wizard: I can indeed! Where are you headed?
User: Let's see what you have for Ulsan
Wizard: Where would you be departing from?
User: Toronto
Wizard: And how many adults and children will be on this trip?
User: Just two adults
Wizard: I'm happy to report that we have a trip between August 30 and September 4, at a 5 star hotel. Would you like to know more about this option?
User: Would you know if it's close to a park?
Wizard: Its near a park, shopping, and a mall!
User: Nice! Forgot to mention my budget is 3300. How much will this trip cost?
Wizard: Unfortunately, none of our trips for two adults fit in that budget. This particular trip costs 6992.48USD. Would you like for me to look up a different destination?
User: There are no cheaper options in Ulsan?
Wizard: The cheapest trip to Ulsan I have costs 4731.5USD.
User: How about Buenos Aires?
Wizard: Unfortunately, we do not have results for Toronto to Buenos Aires.
User: Athens?
Wizard: None for Athens either. :disappointed:
User: I don't think this trip will work out for us then
Wizard: Sorry I couldn't find you a trip...please let me know if I can help with any future trips!
User: No worries, thanks!
