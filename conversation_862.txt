User: I've never done this before but I hope it works. I heard there's cheaper deals on travel if I do it on the computer.  I want to go to Cancun please.
Wizard: Sure thing! Where are you leaving from?
User: We live in Boston, Massachusetts. It's just awful here, you know
Wizard: How many of you will be travelling?
User: There is just me and my grandson, the light of my life. He's 5 and I want to have him all to myself until he starts school.
Wizard: I can offer you both 12 days at La Plaza Del Mundo for just 1606.97USD - business class flights included!
User: Oh my...that's way too much, way more than I won at the jackpot.
Wizard: How much would you like to spend?
User: I only have $1100. We want to go to a very nice place so it's okay if it's only for a short time. Please make sure we are back before the first day of kindergarten or my daughter will kill me!
Wizard: When would you need to be back ? Could you please tell me the date :slightly_smiling_face:
User: His first day of school is September 26 and we can only leave after Sept 12 when his day camp is finished.
Wizard: I have a package that would be perfect for you but would add another 10 dollars and 78 cents onto your budget, if that is ok. You would stay at a 3.5 star hotel in Cancun next to a Cathedral from September 14 until the 26th.
User: Is breakfast included in that? Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, you know.
Wizard: Indeed it is! And free wifi, and free parking.
User: I don't drive so I don't care about parking. Is there a park nearby where my grandson can play?
Wizard: I’m sorry, I have no information about a park nearby.
User: I'm not sure....do you have anything in San Antonio? Something nicer and close to a park?
Wizard: Indeed I do! Winter Hill Inn is near a park, museum, and a mall. It has a 2 star rating, free breakfast and wifi, and you could stay there for 10 days for 1128.48 USD
User: 2 stars? That sounds a little shabby.  What is the guest rating on it? I want something NICE for little Jimmy and I.
Wizard: The guest rating is 4.74/10.
User: No thank you, that sounds like a no-tell motel. Anything with a higher rating?
Wizard: Not within your budget. Sorry.
User: How about if we go to Atlanta?
Wizard: I’m sorry, the cheapest package I have in Atlanta is 1354.13 dollars
User: So the highest rating in a hotel you can provide within my budget is a 3.5 star in Cancun?
Wizard: That’s correct.
User: Okay thank you I think I will call Disney, see if I can book anything with them for a few days. Only the best for my little Jimmy.
Wizard: Good bye.
