The Mellow Palms Resort in Frankfurt is a 10 day package available from Aug 19 to Aug 27 and includes free wifi and  free breakfast and has a 4.5 star rating. The total cost on this package, also based on an economy class flight is $3091.3USD.
User: Is it possible to upgrade the Frankfurt flight to business class?

User: We are leaving from Hogsmeade. It is a terrible place and we wanna get awayyyyy
Wizard: How many people will you be traveling with for this trip?
User: Me, Ron, Harry, and Hagrid. 4 of us
Wizard: I can't seem to find any flights leaving Hogsmeade. Do you have another city you could depart from? I could book you a cheap stay in Kyoto if you fly out from Nagoya.
User: I don't wanna go to Kyoto... how about Nagoya to Toronto???
Wizard: I can book you a stay in the Hotel Richard from August 24th to September 2nd. The total cost of this package is 10986.39USD. How does that sound?
User: that's like 11 grand oh my god!! I need to spend like... 1900 or 2900 MAX. Is there anything cheaper to Paris?
Wizard: How about a stay at Paris' Autumn Treasure Hotel from the 27th of August until the 6th of September? At 2789.83USD this falls well within your budget.
User: I just need a package to Toronto for less than 2900
Wizard: I can offer you a package to Toronto which is only 2275.60USD, however your stay would be from the 17th of August to the 27th.
User: ....is there anything to Paris within my dates???
Wizard: Unfortunately I cannot offer you any packages for Paris. Would you like to try another destination?
User: let's try Toronto again. where would we leave from&gt;
Wizard: If you are flexible with your city of departure I can offer you a cheaper Toronto package which leaves from Calgary. Unfortunately this trip is from the 17th to the 24th of August.
User: Ok.... well maybe we'll just miss a few days of class that week. How much is that package?
Wizard: The total cost of this package is 1568.64 USD. It includes a stay in the Hotel Eric Perrier, a 4-star hotel with free breakfast and free wifi. Would you like me to book this package?

User: Hi there… I need to get some overseas inspiration for my new novel… I’ve got a bit of writers block here in Ciudad Juarez, too much going on
Wizard: Are there any places you have in mind?
User: I was thinking about Manaus. I’m looking to spend a good week away
Wizard: Are you looking for specific dates?
User: Not really…but I’m on a budget (of course - being a writer and what not). 4500 is what I’ve got to spend. Also, my wife and son will be accompanying me
Wizard: I have one result for a flight from Ciudad Juarez to Manaus. It is an 8 day stay at a 3.5 star hotel, they offer free breakfast, wifi and parking. The price you'll be looking at is 4178.82. Would you like me to book this?
User: I’m wondering about Sendai as well though- I could use a little Oriental flare in my writing. Anything available from Ciudad Juarez within my budgeT?
Wizard: Unfortunately, there are no flights to Sendai within your budget.
User: ok… Well are there any other options in Manaus? I just don’t wanna jump at the first thing..
Wizard: Sadly, no. There is only the 8 day stay at the 3.5 star hotel.
User: And what is that hotel called?
Wizard: Serene Garden. There is a flight at 10:am on August 25th, and a 3:00 am on August 30th. Would you like me to book one of these flights?
User: 10 am is far more reasonable travelling with a child, so the August 25th package please.
Wizard: Wonderful! Your flight has been booked! Have a great day and a splendid vacation!
User: Terrific :smile: Thanks for your service!
User: Biebs here. I wanna book a vacation asap.
Wizard: Hi how may I help you!
User: Mah closest friend, Madonna and I want to go to St. Louis. What can you offer. I only want the best, if not I'm going elsewhere.
Wizard: Okay let me try and find the best package for you, where are you leaving from and when would you like to?
User: Well, I'm THE Biebs, so you should know where I'm leaving from. But I'll tell you anyways. We leave from Santiago.
Wizard: When are you planning on travelling?
User: Good man. Doesn't matter when we leave, but I gotta be back by August 28th. I've got a gig on the 29th.
Wizard: I found it for you! The lunar, It’s a five star hotel, leaving on the 18th and returning on the 28th
User: Probably have, you know, with all this fame people need me everywhere to do concerts, signings, just being around... Does it have breakfast included?
Wizard: Breakfast and wifi
User: Nothing but the best. Let's take a look at Santo Domingo first (Madonna likes the heat).
Wizard: Looks like all the hotels in Santo Domingo are 4 stars would any of those work?
User: I'm willing to give it a try. Breakfast?
Wizard: Yes it would come with Breakfast wifi and parking!  but it only leaves on the 24th
User: When does it return?
Wizard: on the 2nd

User: Greeeeeat! Thanks man! Imma send you free tics
User: So Hey, I'm an intern- it's pretty fantastic/exciting. So anyways I need to go to Monterrey between August 27 and September 15. What do you have leaving from Stuttgart?
Wizard: Will you be travelling alone or with a companion?
User: All alone, and for the first time! If I wasn't so excited, I would be really nervous.
Wizard: Do you need to stay in Monterrey right until the 15th of September?
User: My dates are kinda flexible, but I absolute cannot go over a budget of 3100 dollars.
Wizard: Is a five day package in Monterrey acceptable for you? I have a flight departing on Aug 27 and returning on Aug 30 at the Oriental Peaks Hotel. It is a little bit more than what your budget allows for at 3240.72USD but it is a 4-star resort with an excellent client rating and it includes free breakfast, free wifi and free parking.
User: Hmmm it's a little bit too expensive... they have another location in Kingston, can we see what's available there?
Wizard: I have a lot available in Kingston within your travel dates. Are there any special amenities you are looking for at the hotel?
User: Hmmm well this is the first time I book any kind of vacation... Can you tell me what amenities are usually offered?
Wizard: In Kingston, I have hotels available from a 2.5 rated hotel to a 4 star hotel. I also have some hotels that are located near the museum for when you have some leisure time.
User: Wow I'd love to spend some time near the Museum, is this one within my budget?
Wizard: All are within your budget. I can recommend the Golden Excalibur which is available from Aug 27 to Aug 30, is rated 3.5 stars and includes wifi and breakfast.
User: Well that one sounds very nice. Can you give me the name of the hotel near the Museum? I'd like to compare the two hotels with my mom.
Wizard: This one is located right beside the museum. I also have the at the Raven which is a 3 star and the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites which is a 4 star located near the museum.
User: Great! I'll talk about it with my mom and get back to you tomorrow. Thanks so much for your help!!
User: i'm going abroad to check out my options for my internship
Wizard: Hi there! Do you have some destinations in mind?
User: what can you book me from Cancun to Naples under 1200? (they aren't paying me so that is a TIGHT budget)

User: ummmm no im leaving the 27th. last chance: get me something to Boston

User: can you find me a 5 star if i leave from Porto

Wizard: I have 2.5 star, 3 star 3.5 star hotels available. All of them include free wifi. A couple are located near the museum and a couple in the heart of the city near the park. Which location are you more interested in?
User: Being in the heart of the city sounds good! Or do you have any close to the beach?
Wizard: Unfortunately, I have nothing available close to the beach in Kingston at the moment. In the heart of the city, I have the Cosmos Inn available for 6 or 8 day packages. This is a 2.5 star hotel which also includes free parking and a free breakfast. You can fly to there either on economy or business class and still stay within your budget.
User: ok! Are any extras included in the price?
Wizard: No there are not. Would you like me to provide you with some pricing on the 8 day package via business class?
User: Yes that would be great. Could you give me the price of the 8-day package in economy and in business so that I can compare?
Wizard: Cosmos Inn - 8 days in economy class is available from September 8th to Sept 14th. The total cost on this package is 9141.53USD.  Cosmos Inn - 8 days in business class is available from is also available on the same dates for a total cost of 11812.93USD. I can manage this for the 5 of you.
User: Great thanks! Last question about this package, does the hotel have a pool or other amenities?
Wizard: I am sorry, but I do not have access to this information in my database.
User: Alright, that's ok. The other destination we were considering is Lima
Wizard: I have a 9 day package available at the Wolf Inn. It is a 3.5 star resort located near the park. It includes free wifi, free parking and a complimentary breakfast and I only have economy flight available at this time. The total cost is 14057.6USD, so it comes in just under your budget.
User: That sounds pretty good! Otherwise do you have anything close to the beach?
Wizard: I apologize. All of our resorts  located close to the beach in either Kingston or Lima have already been booked up. Would you like to look at other possible destinations?
User: Those are the two destinations we were considering. Can you give me any additional information about the Wolf Inn?
Wizard: The flight departs on September 8th at 11am and returns on September 15 at 2am . Again, this is in economy class seating.
User: Ok! If we increased our budget to 15200, would there be other packages you would recommend for Lima?
Wizard: No unfortunately Wolf is the only resort in Lima available at the moment.
User: How about in Kingston, would other options become available with a slightly higher budget?
Wizard: That's pretty all that is available in Kingston too. Would you like me to proceed with booking before there are no places left?
User: Yes! Then we will go for the Lima package at Wolf Inn!
Wizard: Perfect, I will take all your information down and proceed with the booking. Have a nice day!

Wizard: Where do you live and do you have a wish list of places to go?
User: We live in Los Angeles and we don't have any places in mind, we are just looking to stay at a nice beach resort where we can swim in the ocean, tan, play with the kids on the beach, have some drinks at night, that kind of thing
Wizard: When will you be taking your vacation?
User: Between August 27th and September 3rd!!
Wizard: You are in luck, We have availability at the Glorious Cloak Inn in St. Louis, which is located right by the beach. This is a 4 day package which included wifi and free buffet breakfast for the whole family. This is a 3 star hotel with a 7.15/10 guest rating.
User: Do you have anything longer? We were hoping for about a one week package. It's quite a hassle to fly with the kids so once we get there we want to stay longer than 4 days
Wizard: I have a package available out of Los Angeles flying out to Columbus. This one would be at the Crown Jungle Inn and it is a 6 day long package. It also includes wifi and parking but breakfast is not included. The good news is, it is also close to the beach.
User: That could be cool! What are the dates and the price for this one?
Wizard: The price is $7796.72USD and the dates from August 27 to Sept 1st. This is price is based on an economy class flight.
User: ok thanks! Ya we would be flying economy. The only thing is that i'm not sure how warm the water is in Columbus, do you have any packages for further south? We are really looking for a tropical beach kind of vacation :slightly_smiling_face:
Wizard: St. Louis and Columbus are the only places available that are on the beach at the moment.
User: Oh no! What if the end date was flexible? It's less ideal but we could be back as late as September 14th if that gives us better options. And we don't need to leave exactly August 27th, as long as the trip is about a week long.
Wizard: Do you have a budget for this trip?
User: We don't have a budget set, but like I said we want to fly in economy
Wizard: I have the Summer Covert Club located in Atlanta, United States, also on the beach. This one here is a 7 day package that is available to you from September 8th to September 14th also on economy class for 3463.11USD.
User: That sounds good! How fancy is this hotel?
Wizard: It is a 3.5 star hotel with free wifi and free parking. It is a brand new hotel so it does not have any guest ratings yet.
User: That sounds really good!! I'll book this one :slightly_smiling_face:
Wizard: Fantastic, glad we could help you plan and book your vacation. I hope everything is to your satisfaction.

User: Alright, scratch that. How about for Brasilia?
Wizard: There are no available flights from Monterrey to Brasilia. Would you like to look at package number one again, the one to Porto? That package seemed to suit your dates and budget.

Wizard: I regret to inform you that all Lima hotels in our database are in close proximity to parks. Would you like me to conduct a search in an alternate destination?
User: How miserable. Yes, please search for Seattle results.

Wizard: Ok! Would you lke to go anywhere in particular?
User: Munich
Wizard: Sure! I have September 10-17 available at a 5 star hotel in Munich. The price is $2853 for this package. Are you interested?

User: My name is Lorraine. I would like to book a vacation for myself and my three darling grandchildren, leaving as soon as possible but returning before the children start school on September 19.
Wizard: Where would you like to leave from and where would you like to go?
User: We would be setting off from Burlington. We would be looking to land in Toronto.
Wizard: Burlington to Toronto for 1 adult and 3 children.  I have several options.  Would you prefer to stay in Toronto for 8 or 12 days?
User: I would prefer a longer trip, please! However, it behooves me to make mention of my 3300 budget for this voyage.
Wizard: Most everything I have in Toronto for September is under your $3300 dollar budget. For a 12 day stay, the Hotel Eric Perrier is priced at $2441.0USD and has a 4 star rating. It also has an excellent guest rating of  8.8 / 10.
User: I would like to know if this hotel offers any amenities?
Wizard: Daily breakfast is part of the package, as well as wifi. If you wanted to travel by business class with the children, the price would be 2863.7USD, still below your budget.
User: Can you also be so kind as to check for tickets to Philadelphia?
Wizard: I have one package available in Philadelphia, but unlike Toronto, I only have a 5 day package.  The Mirror Inn is priced at 2498.21USD and has a 2 star rating. The guest rating on this hotel is 6.61/10
User: Understood. I would like to submit an application for the Toronto package, for the economy seat option. But before I do, can you remind me of the dates?
Wizard: You would depart Burlington on September 8th at 11am and return on September 19 at 3am.
User: The return flight is past the children's bedtime. Do you have any other selections?
Wizard: That is the only flight available from Burlington to Toronto on that day.
User: Very well. Please book this trip for me, thank you.
Wizard: I will go ahead with the booking for you. Safe travels.
User: Thank you
User: Do you have hotels in Jerusalem?
Wizard: Sorry, no. 
User: Hi 
Wizard: Hey :slightly_smiling_face: Would you like to book a trip?
User: I need your help to plan the dream vacation for me and my grandson! My grandson has always wanted to visit Porto Alegre.
Wizard: Ok! Where would you depart from?
User: We're both at Toluca.
Wizard: Ok! So am I correct in believing there will be one adult and one child in total?
User: You're smart!
Wizard: Great :slightly_smiling_face: I will get searching for you immediately. Do you have a budget in mind for your trip?
User: Let me know if 3200 will be enough
Wizard: And have you got any time constraints for your vacation? Is there a date you would like to leave? A date you need to return home by?
User: We can leave any day on or after September 2. But we have to get back before September 12
Wizard: Sadly I can’t find anything from Toluca to Porto for one man and one child that costs less than 3200 dollars… would there perhaps be an alternate destination in mind? Or maybe a higher budget you would be willing to work with?
User: I was actually thinking of Toronto...
Wizard: Ok! You’re in luck - I have ONE package left to Toronto within your parameters, and I think it sounds perfect for you! You would depart on September 2nd, and leave Toronto on the eleventh. You’d be staying at the 4 star Hotel Eric Perrier, located near a cathedral and just a few short strides from the airport. You would be treated to free breakfast throughout your stay and have access to free wifi for the duration of your trip. The guest rating is an impressive 8.8/10 and the cost of the package is well within your budget at $2648.63.
User: And we'll have economy seats I assume?
Wizard: Yes, that’s correct.
User: Well, I guess this Toronto package ain't too bad...
Wizard: :slightly_smiling_face: Would you like me to book it?
User: That's wonderful, please do!
Wizard: Consider it done
User: Thank you my dear!
User: Um get me to Kochi
Wizard: Sure! From where would like to depart?
User: Berlin. And get me back by Sept 14

Wizard: I’m sorry, but I have nothing higher than 3.5 stars in my search results.
User: ok fine how about atlanta

User: then get me from columbus to sapporo. dates don't matter but see if you can do it for under 3900
Wizard: I have no travel  packages from Columbus to Sapporo. May I check other destinations?
User: you got any flights to kobe instead?
Wizard: I have several packages in Kobe available for under 3900. Would you prefer to remain in Kobe 12 or 15 days?
User: 15 days? what kind of hotel would that be
Wizard: That would be the Royal Island Inn, close to the market and the palace. The accommodations are 3 star and wifi is provided free of charge.
User: what do other guests think of this place?
Wizard: The guest rating is 0/10, but that may just mean that the hotel has not been reviewed by guests yet.
User: are there any other choices?
Wizard: There are a couple of 12 day options, the Resort Ancient Angel, a 3 star rated hotel with a guest rating of 8.69/10  or 12 days at the White Square, a 3.5 star rated hotel with a guest rating of 6.91/10.
User: Does the first option have any amenities?
Wizard: The first one provides free wifi whereas the second provides free wifi and breakfast
User: is that second one near anything cool?
Wizard: I have no information as to the location of the first hotel but the White Square is located near a park.
User: lets go with that then. i need my free breakfast
Wizard: Would you prefer to be booked on economy or business class flights?
User: what does the business class package cost?
Wizard: It is priced at 3585.81USD. The flight departs on September 8th and returns on September 18th.

Wizard: Yes I do have a few options for Sao Paulo! We've got one 2 star hotel with a 6.91/10 guest rating. We also have two 3 star hotels, with guest ratings of 6.91/10 and 5.14/10. Is there anything you are looking for specifically in your choice of hotels?
User: hmmm.... i think the 3 star hotel with 6.91/10 guest rating sounds good. What is that hotel close to?
Wizard: That is an excellent choice! That hotel is located at the heart of the city, close to a cathedral and a theater.
User: Does the hotel have free wifi?

Wizard: Where do you need to get to?
User: Mexico City. I need to leave on or after September 16.
Wizard: ok! Have you got a travel budget?

User: Is the 3.5 star hotel near anything of note?
Wizard: Are you kidding? It's in the heart of the city and next to a park!

Wizard: That sounds wonderful! Where are you coming from?
User: I'll be coming from Seoul and I'm thinking about going to Curitiba
Wizard: Will it just be yourself?
User: No, it will be me and my best friend.
Wizard: Perfect. We have quite a few range of offerings. Do you have a budget or do you just want to hear the best available packages we have?
User: No budget, just give me the best you've got!
Wizard: Alrighty, our best vacation package is at a 3.5 star beachside hotel. In the past, guests have rated it 8.22/10. While there, you can enjoy access to free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. We offer a 8 day stay there with business flights available. If you are interested, we also have a few 3 star hotels available.
User: You don't have any hotels with 4 stars? And only 8 days? I prefer something longer!
Wizard: The 3.5 star hotel is the best available in Curitiba. And we do offer trips up to 14 days. However, they will be at 3 star hotels. Are you interested?
User: Huh I don't know.
Wizard: I am giving you the best options in Curitiba. Would you like to try another destination?
User: Yeah let's try Sydney. I want the best and I've got like two and a half weeks of free time.
Wizard: Sydney is looking better! I've got a 4.0 star hotel with 8.86/10 guest rating. I can take you there for 6 days on business flights.
User: 6 days only? I was hoping for something longer.
Wizard: This is the only trip available in Sydney.
User: I think Curitiba must be better then.
Wizard: I agree. Would you like to further explore some of the options in Curitiba?
User: I think I'll take the beachside hotel deal for 8 days if that's the best there is.
Wizard: Sure! It will be 12555.78 for the business package. Would you like me to book it for you?
User: I'll take the package
Wizard: Glad to help! This is booked for you! Hope you have a pleasant trip!

User: Very detailed - I appreciated that.However, as much as I do love the BBQ, I also have to look at Recife, as I also thoroughly enjoy the variety of food available there
For that one though could you look for flights out of New York?
I think I'd be stopping back there before heading out
Wizard: For Recife we have a 4 star hotel near a park, 8.22/10 guest rating, free breakfast and wifi, from September 13th to 24th, business flights are 3603.71, and economy flights are 2800.81.  This is The Glee.

User: Oh it's going to be a huge family vacation, so we'll be 5 adults and 7 children! We're looking for something between Monday September 12 and Monday September 19.
Wizard: That sounds very nice! Do you want me to stay under a certain budget?
User: Yes please! That would be great. I don't want to spend any more than $29, 400 total
Wizard: That's reasonable. Alrighty, since there are a lot of options, I will throw a few cities at you. Let me know if any of these catches your eye: Pittsburgh, Santos, Denver, San Diego, La Paz, Boston, and Sao Paulo.
User: Oh wow they all sound so good. Which ones are the most affordable?
Wizard: The options I have previously presented are the longest and best trips that make the most of your budget. However, shorter trips would be more affordable. Would you like me to find the most affordable trips for you instead?
User: Oh I'll see what the longest and best trips are! Please tell me about them. Let's start with San Diego!
Wizard: Maybe Santos, La Paz, or Sao Paulo might interest you. Of course I can run searches for shorter trips and perhaps get a few more available cities if you would like.
User: Let's try La Paz!
Wizard: Nice choice! In La Paz we can offer you an 8 day stay at a fantastic 4.0 star hotel with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi.
User: Ooh sounds nice! How much would that cost in the end?

Wizard: Rome to Essen, nothing available either.
User: you are a disgrace. what about in St. Petersburg?

Wizard: I can help you with that. I have several choices in Kingston. How many people will be travelling to Kingston from Stuttgart?
User: I'm travelling alone ; helps me focus on my sensitive pallet
Wizard: My hotels in Kingston go up to 4 stars and the length of stays between 4 days and ten days.
User: Higher stars are my preference, heart of the city or near a market helps too. Usually close to good restaurants
Wizard: I have the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites, a 4 star hotel which is close to the museum available for 10 days or I have the Cosmos Inn which is a 2.5 star hotel located in the heart of the city available for 7 days.
User: Cosmos Inn sounds like a better location
Wizard: It also includes free breakfast, parking and wifi and has a user rating of 6.37/10
User: However I would love to hear about San Juan 's accommodation offerings.
Wizard: I have the Fairyland with a 4 star rating and a great location near the  museum, shopping and the food market at 2667.37USD for a 6 day stay.
User: Heyy that sounds awesome! What's the price difference between that one and Kingston's package in the heart of the city?
Wizard: The Cosmos Inn in Kingston is  1225.8USD for a 7 day stay, so about half the price.
User: Hmm but yea, San Juan is still a little more appealing...Can we book that one?
Wizard: Yes of course!
User: :ok_hand::knife_fork_plate:

Mexico City package will be the best for us
Wizard: The Mexico City package is 16699.53 which is over your 15000 budget. Are you able to increase your budget or would you like to book the cheaper Mexico City package of 11941.79?

Wizard: There are no flights from St. Louis to Kabul. Can I look into another destination for you?

Wizard: I have nothing available from Miami to Beijing

Wizard: Sorry, I don’t see any in Berlin.
User: I hear Toronto is a good city.
Wizard: Unfortunately I am only seeing trips for one hotel in Toronto and it is not near a park. I am limited in the amount of results I can fetch; if you could suggest a departure city it would be very helpful to narrow down the selection.

Wizard: The only hotel I can see in Belo Horizonte is 2.5 stars. Do you have a maximum length of stay?

User: Can you tell me more about what this package includes please?
Wizard: It is a 2.5 star hotel with free breakfast, free wifi, and free parking.
User: That sounds like a pretty good deal.
Wizard: Ok! Consider it booked.
User: Great, thanks!
Wizard: My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:

User: The 4 star hotel in Rosario, what's that one like?
Wizard: The hotel has a rating of 8.86 out of 10 and you can do some great shopping in the area. Breakfast and wifi is included with the package, and it departs on Friday September 23rd, returning to Salvador on Friday October 7th.
User: k the 23rd should be good...enough time to prepare for the competition. I don't want to spend all my savings though...they don't need to fly on business class that;s for rich people. Whats it cost on economy?
Wizard: The package with economy class would cost a total of 2204.67 USD.  Would you like me to book this package to Rosario for you?

Very rare and very impressive
Anyway

Wizard: I'm afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Tel Aviv either. Would you like to leave from another city?

User: GOODBYE
Wizard: Goodbye. Thank you for using our services.
User: Vacay time woooohooooooo
Wizard: May I book a trip for you?
User: Listen I'm on a budget soooooo I want you to find me the best deal ever understand? We want to go to Phoenix with the kids.
Wizard: How many of you will there be? And where will you be leaving from?
User: There is my wife, me, her mother :grimacing: and our gaggle of 5 kids
Wizard: 3 adults and 5 children then?
User: Yes that's it  we need a good deal
Wizard: What is your budget and where will you be leaving from?
User: We live in Atlanta and no more than $4800 for ALL of us got it?
Wizard: I have an amazing 15 day package costing at a total of $4415.39 for all of you. You will be all set up at a 3 star hotel located near a museum and a university, and this will include free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. Would you like me to book this for you?
User: 3 star? Got anything better?
Wizard: I'm afraid not. That is the most upscale hotel we have of all the packages.
User: What 't the guest rating on the 15 day package?
Wizard: It's the same hotel for the two packages that we have, and the guest rating is 6.91 out of 10. Would you be interested in booking the 15 day package?
User: NO. I would like to see what else you have. Do you have any other hotels or are you giving me just one choice?
Wizard: I'm afraid we only have two packages available for what you're looking for, and they're both with the same hotel. Would you be interested in booking one of these packages?
User: Can you stop asking me that please! We take one vacation every 3 years and I need to look at all my options! If I increase my budget to $5800, what can you offer us?
Wizard: I am afraid that increasing your budget will leave you with the same options, with the 3 star hotel. Is there another destination you would like me to search for you?
User: It's nice that you are meeting my budget but I really need to look at more than just one 3 star hotel in Phoenix. I will shop around and get back to you if I can't find something better. Have a nice day.
Wizard: Thank you for stopping by. Good luck!

Wizard: And how much budget do you have for this trip?
User: i don't really have one, i need to treat myself... within reason of course..
Wizard: In that case, I'll let you know a few offerings we have and we can start from there. Given your selections, we've got a 13 day trip to Paris, and 11 day trips to Detroit, Atlanta, Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Essen. These are the longest trips we offer.
User: oh wow, thanks, but i was actually thinking about going to porto alegre
Wizard: No problem. In Porto we can offer you a 5 day stay at a 3.5 star hotel next to shopping, a university, and a mall.
User: that's alright - i would rather be near like a park, beach, garden.. something like that, i've just been cooped up in an office for ages so outdoor attractions would be better
Wizard: We have no particular hotels in Porto close to outdoor attractions. Would you like to try another destination?
User: ahh, ok, well i was also thinking about denver
Wizard: We only have a 3.0 star hotel in Denver that matches your needs; however, it is not particularly close to any outdoor activities.
User: hm.. well how else does it suit my needs?
Wizard: It works well with your dates since it's a 10 day trip from September 15 to 24, and it is in your destination of choice.
User: ah, ok. maybe you could go back to those places you mentioned before.. i would like to hear about Hiroshima'
Wizard: Sure, in Hiroshima we can bring you to a 3.0 star hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings near a museum.
User: what about Kyoto?
Wizard: In Kyoto we also have a 3 star hotel near a museum. This one has 8.69/10 guest ratings.
User: nice! which is cheaper, hiroshima or kyoto?
Wizard: Hiroshima would be an 11 day trip for 4164.55 while Kyoto would be an 8 day trip for 3435.68.
User: gotcha. well I like the kyoto place more
what is the hotel called?
Wizard: It is none but the Sakura Inn.
User: ok. what is the Paris option you mentioned earlier?
Wizard: Our Paris trip includes a 13 day stay at a prestigious 4.0 star hotel with 8.49/10 rating for 2888.25.
