Wizard: There are two options. Option 1: a 3.5 star hotel, 8.69/10 guest rating, free breakfast, and wifi, price is 1822.69. Option 2: a 3 star hotel, 8.49/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, price is 1811.86. Both hotels are near a museum and both packages are from September 6th to 11th.
