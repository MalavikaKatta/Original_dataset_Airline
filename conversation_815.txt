User: Hello, you can get my friend and me to Mexico City. From Puebla - this shouldn’t be difficult
Wizard: How much are you willing to spend?
User: Get us there whenever but get us back before September 21. We are willing to spend whatever it takes to get the best flights and hotels
Don’t bother if its not 4.5 stars or better
Wizard: The very best in Mexico City is only a 3.5 star hotel. It has a 8.37/10 guest rating though. Will this suffice or do you want to try another city instead?
User: Try Santo Domingo
Wizard: In Santo Domingo I can get you a business package at a 4 star hotel with 8.8/10 guest rating. It offers free wifi, breakfast, and parking and is conveniently located near the beach and shopping.
User: What dates?
Wizard: September 7 to 20.
User: Sign us up
Wizard: Confirmed. You are going to Santo Domingo! 2477.25 total for everything. The confirmation email is on its way. Anything else I can do for you?
User: did you book us business class?
Wizard: Of course, business it is!
