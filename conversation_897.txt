User: My secretary is on vacation so I have to book my own flights today. Definitely feels strange
Please book: San Diego to Rome
Wizard: When would you like to go to Rome?
User: After September 8
Wizard: Do you have a budget or do you just want to hear the best packages we've got?
User: Yes. That would be good. Give me the priciest options, I’ll expense it on the company
Wizard: Got it! The best package we've got is a 11 day stay at a 4.0 star hotel right by the cathedral. It has a guest rating of 8.98/10 and offers free breakfast and wifi. Business package would cost 3458.79.
User: Oh I forgot to mention, we’ll be four adults total
Wizard: Yup, for 4 it will be 13835.19.
User: Cool cool. I was also thinking of spicing it up a little with a long distance trip
Can you look into flights to Osaka, also departing from San Diego
Wizard: Would you prefer a 11 day stay at a 2.5 star hotel or a 6 day stay at a 4.0 star hotel?
User: Oh definitely the 4 star - but what is it near?
Wizard: It's nicely located near a park and a museum.
User: What about Denver? I know a good seafood restaurant there that I could go to
Wizard: In Denver we have a 11 days package at a 4.0 star hotel.
User: Are there decent amenities there?
Wizard: There is wifi free of charge.
User: Ok you know what. I’m really craving some lobster rolls
Nothing else matters
Book us for business
Wizard: Alright get ready for some deliciousness! Your trip is booked for you for 4921.24!
User: Thank you! I’m tempted to do my own bookings in the future now, its fun!
Wizard: I'm glad! I will always be here for you :slightly_smiling_face:
