User: Hi wozbot! My husband and I are recently married and madly in love. We're looking for a fantastic honeymoon vacation. We live in Mannheim and we'd like to go to Kyoto for 6 days leaving on August 19. What can you do for me?
Wizard: Hello,  I have perfect packages available for you that are 5 days in length flying from Mannheim to Kyoto, but none depart on the 19th. Are you a bit flexible with your dates?
User: What's available closest to the 19th?
Wizard: The closest one would be on August 25th returning on the 28th. You would stay at the Glorious Bazaar Resort, which is a 3-star hotel that includes breakfast and wifi. I have both economy class and business class available.
User: This one sounds interesting, but I'd really like a vacation of 6 days, preferably leaving on the 19th of August. Can we take a look at Osaka?
