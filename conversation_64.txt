User: Hello wozbot!
Wizard: Hey there! How can I help you?
User: My husband and I are recently married, we are looking for a honeymoon vacation.
Wizard: Where were you thinking?
User: Perhaps Toronto. We are currently in Rome for business, we'd like to leave from here. We're looking at going from August 18 to August 29th.
Wizard: Ok, great! Are you flexible on those dates by any chance?
User: Not very. The divorce is planned for August 30th.
Wizard: I could book you August 24-August 29?
User: Yes please.
Wizard: Ok, great! Would you like to know any more information before I book?
User: Yes of course! Is the hotel 5 stars?
Wizard: The hotel is 3 stars.
User: This is a very special time for us. I'd like to see what you have that's 5 stars please.
Wizard: How about 4 stars from August 17 to August 22?
User: That is good. Is there a spa?
Wizard: There is no spa.
User: How about breakfast and wifi?
Wizard: Yes - both are included for free!
User: Great! How much is this package with business class?
Wizard: The package costs 4446.60USD with business class flights.
User: That sounds good. My husband loves Vancouver, can we take a look at some packages?
Wizard: Ok! Would you like to leave from Rome or Toronto?
User: From Rome please, and I have a preference for a hotel with a spa. If possible.
Wizard: Hmm.. I'm not seeing any Vancouver options with spas available :disappointed:
User: Any 5 star hotels?
Wizard: I've only got 4 star hotels
User: In that case, how about Columbus?
Wizard: The only dates I have available in Columbus are August 15-25.
User: Ok, what about Calgary? My new boyfriend lives there.
Wizard: I have a 4 star available from August 17-August 21 in Calgary for 2 people.
User: Great! How much?
Wizard: 3201.93USD.
User: Is there a spa?
Wizard: Sadly there is no spa :disappointed:
User: Are there any available that do have a spa?
Wizard: Not in Calgary, sorry about that.
User: That's ok. My husband would probably prefer the Toronto package. Can you please give me the flight details?
Wizard: Certainly! Would you like to fly economy or business class?
User: Business class!
Wizard: You will leave Rome at 9:00 am on Wednesday, August 17th 2016 to arrive in Toronto at 4:07 pm on Wednesday, August 17th 2016.
Leaving Toronto, you flight departs at 1:00 am on Monday, August 22nd 2016 and arrives in Rome at 8:07 am - Monday, August 22nd 2016.
User: Perfect, lets go right ahead and book this one
Wizard: Consider it done!
