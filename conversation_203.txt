User: Hey there, I’m looking to check out a few destinations to see if they’ll be appropriate for me to accept an internship in. I want to travel from August 27-30, just enough to get a taste of each location.
I am leaving from Monterrey and I would like to spend 5200 at most, as my internship is unpaid.
Is there anything available to Kobe for these dates and price?
Wizard: Unfortunately the closest flight I can book you for Kobe would be the 11th of September.  Would you like to hear more about this package?
User: I was also looking at Munich..
Wizard: If you're interested in Munich, the closest I can give you to your requested dates would be the 27th of August to the 1st of September. However, this package falls well within your budget at 2813.20USD.
User: The last destination I am considering is Paris.
Wizard: Unfortunately I can't seem to find anything in Paris matching your required dates.
User: Ok. Well I guess Munich is the best choice.
Let’s go ahead and book that!
Wizard: Wonderful! Your trip has been booked. Have fun!
User: Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
