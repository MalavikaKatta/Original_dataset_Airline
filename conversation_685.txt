User: Can you help me book a trip to Mexico City? We'll be 4 adults and 6 kids from Long Baech.
Wizard: When would you like to travel?
User: Our dates are flexible.
Wizard: I have 6, 9, 10 and 12 day packages available in Mexico City.  Do you have a dollar amount in mind that you are willing to spend?
User: I would prefer the longer packages, but my budget total is 8300.
Wizard: For $8300, the longest I can offer you is 6 days at either the Coast, Sublime Echo or the Hotel Tropic. All 3 are located on the beach.  The first one is a 3.5 star and the other 2 are 3 star resorts.
User: If I increase my budget to $9800, would there be much better options?
Wizard: At that budget, I can offer you the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites for 12 days. Located on the beach, this 3.5 star offers free parking and unlimited wifi. The total price for this resort, economy flights included is 9647.67USD.
User: Are there any other options or is this it?
Wizard: The other option would be a 10 day package at the Hotel Tropic, discussed previously on the 6 day package. This a 3 star resort beachfront resort offered at a cost of 9774.68USD.
User: I would definitely prefer the Exalted Willow Resort & Suites.
Wizard: Should I proceed with the booking then?
User: Yes please!
Wizard: I have taken care of it. Have a good day.
User: Super! Thanks!
