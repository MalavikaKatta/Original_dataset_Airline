User: Good morning! Can you help me out with booking my next vacation?
Wizard: Yes, where would you like to go?
User: Well, I have a few places in mind, would you mind checking them for me one by one?
Wizard: Sure. Before I do I will need a little bit more information. Where are you leaving from?
User: I'm based in Valencia.
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: Nothing set in mind yet. Can you provide a few options in different ranges if possible and I can try to make up my mind?
Wizard: Sure. Are you travelling with anyone else?
User: Not planning on it.
Wizard: When would you like to leave?
User: Oh, this is quite important. I got Tuesday, August 30, 2016 to Saturday, September 10, 2016 approved by my boss, so the date is definitely not flexible.

User: Do you have longer packages at this hotel?
