User: FAMILY VACATION ALERT. ha-ha, dad of the year here!
bringing my 6 little offspring to see their mother in London
we would like to leave from our hometown of Brasilia
dates are flexible, as is budget (7 people is gonna get pricey I would assume) how can ya help me out?
Wizard: I might be able to. When would you like to leave and/or return?
User: dates are flexible, as I've said
Wizard: There are no results from Brasilia to London. Are you able to go to a different destination?
User: We can go to Mexico City and make our way to London from there
but I can handle that, you just check Brasilia to Mexico City for us please

User: oh it doesn't matter really, but the shorter trips would probably be more suitable so we can head to London sooner. what are the hotel details from the 8th to the 12th?
