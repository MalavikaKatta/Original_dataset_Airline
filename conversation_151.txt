User: I only start work on Monday Sept 5th so I would have to be back by Sunday at the very latest!
Wizard: Any destination in mind
User: Anywhere within my budget that gets me out of here! Do you have anything in Canada? I like Canada, they are real nice up there.
Wizard: i have som eavailabilities for you, such as Punta Cana, San Juan, Columbus, Baltimore, and Calgary
User: What sort of packages do you have in Calgary? I want something classy if possible.
Wizard: I have the Amusement available for 9 days, it is a 4 star hotel, it leaves on the 17th and returns on the 25th and is a total of $683, would you like me to upgrade that to business class?
User: That sounds SO perfect! The dates are great and so is the price! How much would it be for business class?
Wizard: business class would come out to $917
User: That's $300 less than I budgeted, sound like a great getaway, do I need to book that now?
