User: hey there, I'm doing some travelling for business soon. It needs to be around August 18-August 26. What can you do for me?
Wizard: Letâ€™s see what we can find, can you tell me if you have a budget and who you will be travelling with?
User: no budget - work is paying :wink:
Wizard: Where are you coming from?
User: just me for now, but if we can find something that works out then I have 5 other colleagues who will be attending meetings with me
Wizard: Any chance you can go to or from somewhere else?

Wizard: again i am sorry there are no results
User: i will take my business elsewhere.. thanks for nothing
Wizard: my apologies
