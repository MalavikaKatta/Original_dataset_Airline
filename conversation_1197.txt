User: My lover and I just got married - like TODAY And we wanna fly off to Brazil for a week or so. Can you get us to Buenos Aires from Toronto for just under 5000 ?
Wizard: I am afraid we have nothing within your budget of 5000. Is your budget flexible by any chance?
User: Nope, not at all. We’d settle for Chicago though. Anything there?
Wizard: Yes there is! We have 6, 9, and 10 day packages. Do you have any preferences in terms of the number of days or anything else?
User: Are they all under $4800 ?
Wizard: Yes
User: Great! Tell me about the 6 and 9 day packages.
Wizard: All the hotels are 2.5 stars. The 9 day package has a hotel closer to the city whereas there are two 6 day packages with one hotel closer to the city and the other hotel closer to the airport. What sounds good to you?
User: 9 days in the city would be nice. Amenities ? Also, please tell me the guest rating is 3.5higher than 2.10 ...
Wizard: Good choice! The guest rating for this hotel is 8.69/10 and it includes parking, breakfast, and wifi! Would you like to book this trip?
User: That’s a relief … yeah lets do it please! When do we leave?
Wizard: Tuesday September 13th. Economy or business?
User: What are the respective prices?
Wizard: 1566.64 for economy and 1894.10 for business. Which one would you like?
User: Wow - business absolutely!
Wizard: Consider it booked! Enjoy your holiday!
User: Thank you
