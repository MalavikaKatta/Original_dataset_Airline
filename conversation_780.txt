User: You're right!
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: I only have 2800 left.
Wizard: We have a 3.5 star hotel near a park, 8.86/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi, from September 2nd to 16th, business price is 1953.80, economy price is 1583.20.
User: Are there any other options?
Wizard: Only 2.5 star hotels.
