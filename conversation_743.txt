User: Hello
Wizard: hello there
User: Could you book me a flight from Belem to Punta Cana?
Wizard: One adult?
User: 2 adults
Wizard: Do you have a set date of departure?
User: No date of departure for this trip, but I would prefer earlier if possible
Wizard: The earliest I have is Sept 2nd, how does that sound? That package would put you in Punta Cana for 16 days. Do you have a cap on how much you want to spend?
User: That should work. I actually donâ€™t for this trip. But can you keep it to something reasonable, like under 6100?
Wizard: This particular package on economy class flights is 4289.9USD. Do you want more details on the hotel?
User: is it near the airport?
Wizard: It is near the cathedral and the palace. In Punta Cana, I have nothing near the airport available.
User: Thats fine, lets just go with that
Wizard: Okay your stay will be at the Sunrise Elephant Hotel and you will depart on Sept 2 and return on Sept 17. We appreciate your booking
User: Thanks!
