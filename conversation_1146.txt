User: Hi there I'd like to take my family on vacation.
Wizard: Ok! Where?
User: We haven't decided on a destination yet, but we'll be leaving from Boston.
Wizard: Ok! When can you travel? And how many of you are there?
User: We'll be 4 adults and 1 child, looking for a trip between Monday September 12 and Saturday October 1st.
Wizard: Ok! I have a lovely trip for you to Goiania that would cost 12388.4USD for your whole family. The hotel is Scarlet Palms Resort which is 3.5 stars and is located near both parks and shopping districts.
User: That does sound pretty good. How many days is that?
Wizard: 13 days.
User: It does suit my budget, which is 14700 maximum. But I am curious about other destinations.
Wizard: You can all travel to Light View Hotel in Columbus and spend 18 days for only 4697.60USD.
User: Whoa that's amazing. But we're looking for somewhere more exotic, so preferably somewhere outside the continent, if possible!
Wizard: How about 17 days in New York for 3487.19USD?
User: Isn't that still in the US? Can you suggest another interesting place for me? Maybe with a four or five star hotel?
Wizard: The highest rated hotels I am seeing are the Light View and Scarlet Palms hotels in Columbus and Goiania, respectively.
User: What are the travel dates for the Goiania package please?
Wizard: September 13-October 1.
User: Wow, that's perfect! Yes, please book this trip for us! My family will be so happy!
Wizard: Ok - consider it booked :slightly_smiling_face:
User: Perfect! Thank you.
Wizard: No problem.
