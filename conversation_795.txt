User: Hey, I need to get to Mannheim asap
Wizard: Hi there, I can certainly help you with that.
User: I live in Brasilia so i need to fly out from here. I only have 2200.
Wizard: Unfortunately we do not have any availabilities. Would you have an alternative destination or departure city?
User: Do you have anything to Sao Paulo?
Wizard: Yes I do have a few options for Sao Paulo! We've got one 2 star hotel with a 6.91/10 guest rating. We also have two 3 star hotels, with guest ratings of 6.91/10 and 5.14/10. Is there anything you are looking for specifically in your choice of hotels?
User: hmmm.... i think the 3 star hotel with 6.91/10 guest rating sounds good. What is that hotel close to?
Wizard: That is an excellent choice! That hotel is located at the heart of the city, close to a cathedral and a theater.
User: Does the hotel have free wifi?
Wizard: You bet! It also offers free breakfast.
User: Yum! This hotel is sounding pretty dope. How much is the package?
Wizard: We have a 4 day economy package for $911.52 leaving September 12, and a 6 day economy package with a slight increase of price at $958.90 leaving September 13. If you are interested, we also have a 6 day business package with the same dates for $1157.39.
User: What are the dates for the 6 day business package?
Wizard: It is from September 13 to 18.
User: That sounds great! I'm down, book me this package please :slightly_smiling_face:
Wizard: Okay, you are all set! Hope you have a great time at Sao Paulo :slightly_smiling_face:
