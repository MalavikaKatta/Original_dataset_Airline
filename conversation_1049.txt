User: Let me tell you about the succulent oysters I had last time I was in Kingston..
I'm trying to get back there though, and to leave from Stuttgart
For 4300 dollars
Wizard: Is Kingston your destination?
User: Yea
Wizard: I can help you with that. I have several choices in Kingston. How many people will be travelling to Kingston from Stuttgart?
User: I'm travelling alone ; helps me focus on my sensitive pallet
Wizard: My hotels in Kingston go up to 4 stars and the length of stays between 4 days and ten days.
User: Higher stars are my preference, heart of the city or near a market helps too. Usually close to good restaurants
Wizard: I have the Ebony Manor Inn & Suites, a 4 star hotel which is close to the museum available for 10 days or I have the Cosmos Inn which is a 2.5 star hotel located in the heart of the city available for 7 days.
User: Cosmos Inn sounds like a better location
Wizard: It also includes free breakfast, parking and wifi and has a user rating of 6.37/10
User: However I would love to hear about San Juan 's accommodation offerings.
Wizard: I have the Fairyland with a 4 star rating and a great location near the  museum, shopping and the food market at 2667.37USD for a 6 day stay.
User: Heyy that sounds awesome! What's the price difference between that one and Kingston's package in the heart of the city?
Wizard: The Cosmos Inn in Kingston is  1225.8USD for a 7 day stay, so about half the price.
User: Hmm but yea, San Juan is still a little more appealing...Can we book that one?
Wizard: Yes of course!
