User: Hi! We're thinking of going to Washington. Will try to get all 19 of us to go if that's possible!
Wizard: Departing from where?
User: Beautiful Jerusalem
Wizard: Unfortunately, we do not service Jerusalem at this time. Perhaps another point of departure is available to you?
User: I guess I'll have to look elsewhere
Wizard: Sorry!
