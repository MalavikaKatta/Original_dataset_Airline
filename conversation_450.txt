User: Ok so I've been DYING to visit Goiania and I can finally take some time off. What do you have leaving from Berlin, preferably between August 25th and september 3rd?
Wizard: Hey! How about August 27 until August 31?
User: That's a bit short, anything longer? There is so much I want to see there :smile:
Wizard: I don’t have any longer trips within your date range.
User: Ok well tell me more about this one then :slightly_smiling_face:
Wizard: Sure :slightly_smiling_face: The hotel is 3.5 stars, called the Scarlet Palms Resort. Guests have given the hotel a 7.15/10 rating and the Scarlet Palms is located near shopping and a park. Your package includes free wifi, free breakfast, and free hotel parking. The total for this vacation package would be $2521.
User: Wow! Sounds so nice! It just feels like a lot of money for such a short trip. What if I traveled from september 8-16 instead?
Wizard: I don’t have anything between those dates, however I could book you 10 days at the Scarlet Palms hotel from August 28 until September 6 for a cost of 3103.57USD
