User: Have you ever read the book "Vernon's Travels"?
Wizard: I do not understand your question. I can only help you search a database for the best trip opportunities on-line. Therefore, I will require a departure and a destination.
User: How much would it cost to get two adults and a child from Monterrey to Paris for 14 days?
Wizard: Could you please provide a desired departure date
User: Totally flexible. But I need to spend less than 4700
Wizard: I will now look for packages under $4700 to Paris...I have found several but I am afraid that they do not meet your budget. I can continue to search for you if you provide me with new guidelines.
User: If Paris is a no-go, how about Kingston? Or just look into shorter trips for me
Wizard: I have found a package that meets all you needs but it is only an 8 day package at the Cosmos Inn - in Kingston, Canada departing on Sept 8 and returning on Sept 15th. This package is available for the price of  $4142.76USD and includes unlimited wifi, parking and breakfast at no additional cost.
User: Wow that seems decent. Any chance I could book this but for a longer time period?
Wizard: No it is only accessible for an 8 day or a 5 day stay.
User: Ok fair enough, that seems like my best option then
Wizard: Would you like me to proceed with booking?
User: Yes
Wizard: Your choice of package has been booked.
