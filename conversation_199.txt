User: Hello! I recently won the internship lottery to Kobe where I will work for free! I'll be leaving from Alexandria. What can you offer?
Wizard: I do not have any flights from Alexandria to Kobe.
User: Do you have any flights from Alexandria to Berlin??
Wizard: I do not.
User: What about Alexandria to Salvador?
Wizard: Unfortunately those are not available either. I wish I could be of further assistance.
User: That is really too bad. Thank you for your help.
