Wizard: Ok, leaving on the 17th I have two hotel options - both are 3.0 stars with free parking, wifi, and breakfast.
User: what are the price differences?
Wizard: Would you like to compare the packages with economy or business class flights?
User: yes please, is there a different price between hotels?
