User: Ok, well tell me more about that place

User: Before I go ahead with that can you still tell me whatcha got in Cancun?? I hear that Mewtwo might have been spotted there more recently than Toronto..
Wizard: We have one package at the Winter Vale Hotel available from September 21st to October 2nd. This is a 4 star hotel, 9.16/10 guest rating, free wifi, breakfast, and parking.

Wizard: The hotel in Cancun is near a cathedral and university, if that makes a difference to you.
User: What!? How could you not have told me that before! Cancun it is!
