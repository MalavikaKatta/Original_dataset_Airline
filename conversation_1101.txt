User: Hi I'd like to take a trip.
Wizard: Sure! Where do you want to go?

Wizard: Would you like to fly from Guadalajara to Rio de Janeiro?
User: No, I'm leaving from Mexico City, but I want to go to both places if that's possible.
Wizard: Would you like to go from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro?
User: Sure. But can I go to Guadalajara from Rio de Janeiro after that?
Wizard: I don’t understand.
User: I mean, I want to go two cities.
Wizard: I do not have flights to the destination “two cities”.

User: I don't need to go there for that long. Can you give me a shorter package deal?
Wizard: How about 7 days for 1607.99USD? You would leave on September 8th.
User: That sounds pretty good.
Wizard: Ok! Would you like some more information?
