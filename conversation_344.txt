Wizard: Absolutely! When would you like to go? And where are you located?

Wizard: Ok! Sure! How many of you would be travelling?
User: Two adults and two children
Wizard: Would you be interested in travelling from August 27-September 2?
User: Potentially, if that's all you have. Can you let me know how much that costs?
Wizard: That would cost $3961.65 for your entire family.
User: Yikes, that is over our budget of $2300. Can you see how much a trip to Indianapolis would cost?
Wizard: I can book Aug 30-Sep 7 for  2031.51USD
User: Could you find something that fits within August 25 to September 5?
Wizard: Not in Indianapolis, I’m sorry :disappointed:
User: Alright. In that case, can you check prices going to Toronto?
Wizard: I can book August 27 until September 2nd for 1807.58USD.
User: Excellent. What kind of hotel comes with that package?
Wizard: The hotel is 3 stars with a user rating of 8.86 stars. The hotel has free wifi, parking, and breakfast.
User: And are the flights economy or business class?
Wizard: Economy
User: How much would it cost if we upgraded to business class?
Wizard: Sorry but I don’t have any business class options available.
