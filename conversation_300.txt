User: Hello! I want to book a trip for two adults and two children from August 25th to August 31st. We have several destinations in mind. Do you have any packages for Manaus?
Wizard: I do but in order to provide you with the proper information, I would need to know your city of departure
User: Oh yes! We will be flying out of Calgary
Wizard: From Calgary to Manaus, within your dates, I only have one option that I can present you with. It would ba an 8 day package at the 2.5 star  Hotel Aquamarine River located near the shopping district. This option includes the usual amenities such as free parking, free wifi and free breakfast for the entire family.
User: Does this hotel have good user reviews?
Wizard: It is rated 6.77/10. Would you like me to look at other possibilities for you and your family flying out from Calgary?
User: Yes, I have several destinations in mind. To compare the options can you tell me how much the Manaus trip would be? Another destination we are considering is Tokyo
Wizard: If you flew vis economy class, the price would be 6988.7USD. If you chose to upgrade to business class, the price would be 8992.24USD. I regret that I have no flights to Tokyo out of Calgary.
User: Ok thanks! How about to Minneapolis? We would be flying in economy

User: The last place we were considering was Sao Paulo
Wizard: Let me have a look at Sao Paulo for you. Anything in particular you would like me to look for?
User: What do you mean?
Wizard: Close to the museum, or near a park, or maybe near a beach? My earliest departure to Sao Paulo from Calgary is on Sept. 2nd.

Wizard: That one was available from August 25th to August 31st. The package price for the Hotel Aquamarine River for 4 people was 6988.7USD.
