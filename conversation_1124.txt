User: I wanna go to Sao Paulo from Osaka for 6800
Wizard: Just you?
User: oui
Wizard: I can put you for 7 days in a 3 star hotel in the heart of Sao Paulo. How does that sound?
User: maybe. Do you have anything better?

User: Anything in Queenstown?
Wizard: Absolutely! In Queenstown our best is a 5 star hotel with 8.86/10 ratings. I can put you there for 6 days.

Wizard: Unfortunately no.
