User: Hi! I have 6 days vacation and I don’t know where i’d like to go, was hoping you could help.
Wizard: Happy to help! Which dates are your vacation and where are you coming from?
User: I can leave on or after Monday and i would need to leave from Rosario
Wizard: Is there a budget you'd like me to work with?
User: nope!
Wizard: Okay, we offer 6 day trips starting on Monday to Maceio, St. Louis, and New York. If none of these destinations interest you, we have a few other destinations with 5 day trips.
User: I’d like to look at just the 6 day trips and if i dont find anything i like we can look at the 5 day trips. Whats the best you have in Maceio?
Wizard: It would be a 3.5 star hotel close to the park and shopping with 8.37/10 guest ratings.
User: not too shabby, anything to St. Louis?
Wizard: In SL we have a 3.0 star beachside hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings.
User: That’s the best in SL?
Wizard: It's the best that works with your vacation dates.
User: Okay, um let’s hear what ya got for New York.
Wizard: We've got a 2.5 star hotel near the museum and airport. It has a guest rating of 8.22/10.
User: no way. Do you have any 5 star hotels anywhere?
Wizard: No
User: Well can i hear them anyway, I might be willing to work something out if i find a package that’s worth it.
Wizard: We actually don't have 5 star hotels available for any trips 6 days or under leaving from Rosario. Would you be able to make your dates flexible or leave from another city?
User: No. You know what, it’s fine, I’ll just look somewhere else or take my vacations days another time if i cant find a trip. Thanks anyway.
