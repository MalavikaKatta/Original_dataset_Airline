User: Hi, I want to take my kid to Maceio. Will you be able to help me with this trip?
Wizard: Yes. Where will you be leaving from?
User: Sorry forgot to tell you! We're in Paris.
Wizard: How many people altogether?
User: So myself and my child
Wizard: What is your budget?
User: Nothing specific in mind. Can you show me a few options to help me decide?
Wizard: Sure, when would you like to leave?
User: We don't have a preference. We just want to go for a few days... maybe a week
Wizard: There are no results. Can you leave from a different location?
User: We could also leave from Sao Paulo
Wizard: There are no results for this either.
User: Sorry my bad. I meant we can also go to Sao Paulo instead of Maceio.
Wizard: We have a 3 star hotel in the heart of the city, near a cathedral, and theatre. There is a 6.91/10 guest rating and they offer free breakfast and wifi. This is a business class flight from September 12th to 18th and the price for this package is 5881.15.
User: We could actually do with economy flights
Wizard: Yes, the economy package is 4576.56.
User: That works! Can you book it for me?
Wizard: Sure! It is booked and you will receive a confirmation email soon! Have a great day!
User: Awesome thanks!
