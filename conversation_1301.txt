User: Are there 5 star hotels in Kyoto?
Wizard: Not that I can see from an initial search. Perhaps if you give me a budget, dates, number of travellers, or some other information I can take a closer look.
User: Well we can leave anytime. Need to back in San Antonio by the 15th though	
It'll be the 2 of us	
Wizard: Unfortunately I’m only seeing 3 star hotels..
User: What about Guadalajara? I could also leave from Brasilia too if that changes anything..
Wizard: In Guadalajara I have a 3 star hotel with a 8.22/10 guest rating. This is the closest thing I can find to a 5 star hotel.
User: Okay 3 :star: aint gonna work
Wizard: Sorry I couldn’t help!
User: No worries thanks!
