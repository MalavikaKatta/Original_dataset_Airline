User: Hey there, I'm excited to book a trip somewhere for me and my colleagues.
Wizard: How many of you?
User: There will be 27 of us.
Wizard: Where are you located, and where would you like to go?
User: We're in Beijing we're thinking of going to Santo Domingo.
Wizard: I’m sorry, but we currently do not operate out of Beijing. Is there an alternative departure point available for you?
User: No, because all 27 of us live in Beijing.
Wizard: I’m sorry, then I cannot help you.
User: That's okay, I'll find another way to book it, I'm sure!
