User: Hey, I really need to get out of Tofino for a while. Any chance to leave on Aug 29?
Wizard: Where would you like to go?
User: Stuttgart would be a cool place to go.
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: I've only got 3100 actually.
Wizard: Are you travelling by yourself?
User: Right on.
Wizard: There are no results showing for your request.
User: Any chance if I leave from Busan instead?
Wizard: Nothing within your budget.
User: Uh.. okay. I guess I can settle for Dallas. Still leaving from Tofino though.
Wizard: No, sorry.
User: Alright I'm gonna give it a last shot. What about Dallas from Busan?
Wizard: No, sorry!
