User: Good afternoon! I would like to inquire about travel options between several cities. The trip would need to be between September 8th and 17th. The first option would be between Stuttgart and Baltimore.
Wizard: I have the 3 star Countryside Resort free from Sept 12-17. Would this interest you?
User: That would fit our needs quite well, does the hotel offer wifi to its guests?
Wizard: Certainly! As well as free parking and breakfast.
User: Excellent, that was quite fast! Can you please book this trip for my 5 colleagues? And please let me know of the price first
Wizard: Of course - for 5 adults the price would be 16788.89USD. Do you wish to continue booking&gt;
User: Yes, that is a reasonable price
Wizard: Great. I will book it for you. Please enjoy your stay.
User: Thank you for you kind assistance
