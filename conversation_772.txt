User: Everyone in Europe is raving about this artisanal bratwurst they’re serving up in Hamburg, and I must get myself other there as soon as I can to blog about it! Do you offer flights there out of Seattle?
Wizard: I sure do! When do you want to travel?
User: ASAP, but otherwise dates are flexible
budget is 3800
Wizard: Great! I have a package leaving on August 31 until September 11. The cost is 2157 dollars
User: Oh nice I’m just going to check my other travel options for something cheaper
such as…Santos to Hamburg?
Wizard: There is nothing cheaper.
User: Now if I really wanted to pinch pennies, I could also just travel to St. Louis instead
Wizard: From Santos?
User: From Seattle
Wizard: You could go from August 31st to September 16th for $532, at a 5 star hotel!
User: That is dirt cheap! I could just splurge on my meals instead. What kind of hotel do you have?
As in, tell me more about the 5 star
Wizard: 5 stars, as I said.
User: Amenities?
Wizard: Free breakfast and free wifi are included.
User: Ok lets do that
Wizard: Ok! I’ll book it for you.
User: Thanks!
