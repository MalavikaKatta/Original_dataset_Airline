User: Hi there. I have been tasked with bringing my big beautiful family on a trip! We need to go between August 30 and September 20. We've got 13100 dollars to spend and are leaving from Dublin. Lets hear whats available in St. Louis!
Wizard: I would be happy to check that for you! How many adults and children will you be travelling with?
User: 6 babies and one wife and me
Wizard: I can offer you an 18 day stay at a 5 star hotel or a 14 day stay at a 3 star hotel. Which one would you like to hear more about first?
User: :open_mouth: 5 star! Tell me more!
Wizard: With pleasure! The Lunar comes with complimentary breakfast and wifi and has excellent reviews of 8.98/10.  I can even offer you flights in business class for 9795.16USD so you would still be well under budget.
User: So, if we went to Santo Domingo.. what is available there?
Wizard: There I have a 4 star hotel that you could visit for 13 days. It is close to the beach and shopping and includes free breakfast, wifi and parking. How does that sound?
User: Sounds lovely as well. What would the price be ?
Wizard: Once again this package is well within you budget with the business class package coming out at only 7417.75USD.
User: Great! Cheaper, but we don't need to be cheap really. And could you tell me what would be available in SF?
Wizard: In San Francisco we only have 2 and 2.5 star hotels. Would these interest you or are you looking for a fancier stay like the ones I offered you in SL and Santo Domingo?
User: Yeah, not interested.. would only be in San Francisco to see in-laws anyway so I'll tell the old lady its all booked up except for a couple of dumps. I wanna book the SL 5 star - what is it close to ?
Wizard: Unfortunately I do not have information about nearby attraction. Would you still like me to book it for you?
User: Yes, lets book! :smile: Thanks so much!
Wizard: My pleasure, have a wonderful holiday with your family!
