User: You can help me by finding me a vacation from Munich to San Juan between August 27 and September 3.
Wizard: The only flight we have available is for August 27 to September 2. Would this still work for you?
User: Yes, it would. Can I hear some more information about the package?
Wizard: Absolutely! You would be staying at The Brass Tower Inn, a 2.5 star hotel close to the famous market. Guests have rated this hotel 7.06/10, and it provides amenities such as free breakfast and free wifi. How many adults and children are you looking to book for?
User: Great. Book for one adult.
Wizard: Done. The cost will be 3030.88USD. Bon voyage, my friend!
