User: Hi! I'm getting married and we are super tight on money but I want to be able to give my new bride the best possible honeymoon despite our tight budget, do you have any cool honeymoon destinations that you can recommend?
Wizard: Hi yes i will try my best to find the perfect location! what budget do you have in mind? Where are you from and Where are you thinking of going?
User: Actually, my bride, who is sitting next to me just told me that she wants to go to Porto! Do you have anything in Porto Alegre? We are getting married in Fort Lauderdale on August 18th, so we want to leave on our honeymoon on the 19th.  I CANNOT spend more than $4000.00 though.
Wizard: So it seems that there are no packages available to Porto, is there anywhere else in mind?
User: Well, how about Guadalajara then. I heard it's still pretty dangerous there, but it apparently has some nice beaches! We just gotta keep it under $4000!
Wizard: im sorry to tell you this but there seems to be no packages for there either, we have dominican republic if you are interested?
User: I heard the food sucks in Dominican Republic, but if it's within our budget and at least 6 days, I guess I'll take some info on Dominican Republic. Is it at least a five star hotel?
Wizard: Actually there is only a 2.5 star  hotel
User: Okay this really sucks, is that all you can offer me? No Porto, no Guadalajara and a crappy hotel in Dominican Republic. Surely you must have other destinations on August 19th???
Wizard: We have a 9 day trip starting on August 29th to Mexico City in a 3.0 star hotel called Sublime Echo
User: That does not work for us, we have to leave on the 19th and I only have a week off work. Have a nice day.
Wizard: it seems that there are packages to Porto but only later in august are you flexible with your dates?
User: Like I said, we are NOT flexible. The wedding is already planned for the 18th. Good bye.
Wizard: bye bye
