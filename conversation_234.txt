User: Hey I live in Mos Eisley and I need to book a flight!
Wizard: I can't seem to find any flights out of Mos Eisley. Would you like to try another departure destination?
User: I could drive to Columbus and try to leave out of there instead
Wizard: In that case, I can offer you a four-day package to Seattle for 311.64USD. Would you like to hear more about this package?
User: Where would I have to fly out of to go to Ulsan then?
Wizard: I can book you a flight to Ulsan from Columbus. You would be stayong at the Grandiose Willow Resort for 12 days, bringing your total cost to 2645.30USD. However, if you are flexible on your city of departure, I can book you a package that leaves from Hiroshma, Japan that is only 228.28USD. Would you like to hear more about either of these packages?
User: My travel dates are from August 15 to August 24. Does the package out of Columbus (to Ulsan)  meet my requirements?
Wizard: Unfortunately all available packages from Columbus to Ulsan depart on the 27th of August.
User: And if I leave from Hiroshma?
Wizard: Unfortunately the 27th of August is the closest date of departure I can give you if you are leaving from Hiroshma.
User: okay thank you good bye
Wizard: Thank you for using our service! Have a nice day!
