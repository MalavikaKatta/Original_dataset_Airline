User: Hey, never done this before, but I'll give it a try! I finally have some time off work and I want to see if you can help me book my vacation!
Wizard: OK :slightly_smiling_face: I’d love to help you. Where are you located and where would you like to go?
User: I am in Tijuana, send me anywhere nice!
Wizard: Sure! How many days would you like to travel?
User: 12 days. I can leave on September 18th or shortly thereafter :grinning:
Wizard: And have you got a budget?
User: Nah, I will take what appeals to me the most
Wizard: Ok! I have 12 day trips available in Barcelona, Belem, Dallas, and Minneapolis. Do any of these destinations interest you?
User: Dallas sounds like fun, whatcha got there?
Wizard: I’m sorry - I had an error in my search. I actually have 10 day packages in Dallas, that is the longest available. You would stay at a 2.5 star hotel in the heart of the city near a museum.
User: Nothing on the beach?
Wizard: Sorry, unfortunately not.
User: Okay tell me what you have in Barcelona please
Wizard: In Barcelona I have a 10 day stay with a 3 star rating and 8.86/10 guest review rating.
User: What's it close to?
Wizard: A museum.
User: Out of all the destinations that you gave me, do any of them have a hotel on the beach?
Wizard: I have an 11 day package in Belem at a 4 star hotel near a beach and airport.
User: THAT one sounds good. What else comes with the package?
Wizard: Free parking, complimentary breakfast, and unlimited wireless internet access are all included in the package!
User: When would I depart and return?
Wizard: September 27th would be your departure date and you would return to Tijuana on the 6th of October.
User: No departures to this hotel before the 27th?!?
Wizard: I have an 8 day package to this hotel leaving on September 26th if you would prefer.
User: How much would that cost me?
Wizard: 3839.49USD for a business class ticket.
User: How about economy? Business is a waste of money!
Wizard: If you choose to fly economy class, the cost would be 3001.10USD.
User: That sound pretty good for 12 days! Can I book that one please?
Wizard: That is an 8 day trip.
User: Oh yeah...how much is the 12 day package that leaves the next day?
Wizard: An 11 day stay at this hotel would cost 2267.62USD if you fly economy class.
User: So this one is CHEAPER than the 8 day package even though it is at the same hotel?
Wizard: Yes - correct. It leaves one day later.
User: Weeeelllll this is a no brainer, I 'll just leave the next day and save a whole lotta money! Can you book this for me right away so I don't lose it?
Wizard: It's booked!
