User: I'm getting married and my husband really want to go to Kobe on our honeymoon
Wizard: Hi there! What city will you be departing from?
User: We are getting married in Phoenix, having a good old southern wedding. It's costing my parents a fortune. Make sure the honeymoon is cheap please cause my husband has no money either.
Wizard: The best deal I could offer you on a trip to Kobe would be a 2886.64USD package. I could set you up in the White Square. You would be flying out on the 27th of August. Would you like to hear more about this package?
User: You have nothing around the 18th?
Wizard: If it fits into your schedule, I could book you in the Ivory Legacy Hotel from the 17th to the 21st of August. The total cost of this package is 2934.51USD. Would you like to hear more about this package?
User: No it does not suit our schedule, the wedding is on the 17th. Do you have anything to Rome instead?
Wizard: Unfortunately the nearest date I could offer you for a flight to Rome would be the 27th of August. Would you like to try another destination?
User: No forget it. We need to leave on the 18th.
Wizard: Understood, thank you for using our service!
