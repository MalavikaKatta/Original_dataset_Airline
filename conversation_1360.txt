Wizard: Ok, where would you like to go?
User: Kyoto from crazy noisy St. Louis
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: 5400 for the 3 of us
Wizard: All adults?
User: Yes my wife and son will be coming with me but he is 18
Wizard: Okay. Do you have dates in mind?
User: I need 12 days to finish my book and we can go anytime
Wizard: There are no results.
User: Try Leon instead please, heard it's quiet there too
Wizard: There are no results for this either.
User: what if we only stay 9 days at either Kyoto or Leon, can you find me something?
