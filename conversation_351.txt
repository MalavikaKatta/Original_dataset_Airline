User: Hi there
Wizard: HI :smile:
User: I'm looking to leave from San Diego to a vacation destination. I have saved up approximately $0 for this trip. Can you help me find a suitable location?
Wizard: No
User: Wow alright. How about if I told you I had $400, can you buy me a round trip ticket to Phoenix?
Wizard: I can send you to Calgary, Philadelphia, Punta Cana, or Atlanta.
User: Phili sounds good! How many days?
Wizard: You can spend 6 days in historic Philadelphia, United States for only $366.99 if you leave from rustic San Diego, USA.
User: How many days can I spend in Calgary?
Wizard: You can go to Calgary for 6 days.
User: Can you put me up at the Super 5 Hotel?
Wizard: How about the Amusement? It may only but 4 stars but it is pretty good
User: Book it! Nothing like fun in the city with my tight budget
Wizard: You're trip is booked!
