User: Help! My wife is working in Berlin and I need to bring the children to see her. They are driving me crazy!
Wizard: Sure! Where will you leave from, and how many children are you travelling with?
User: We are in Seoul. As much as I would like to just stick them on a plane on their own, I 'll have to go too! There are 5 little hellions and me. This flight is going to be a nightmare!
Wizard: I have two different 5 star hotels available for your stay! Would you like to travel between the 8-14 or the 3-13?
User: The sooner the better, they are driving me nuts! First she pops out 5 kids, and then she leaves them with me :tired_face:
Wizard: So you would like to travel the third?
User: Yes the third. Today's the 1st right? 2 more sleeps!
Wizard: For a 12 day stay at Starlight Hotel, leaving Seoul on September third, the price would total 12443.40USD for one adults and five children flying in economy class. The hotel features a 8.86 guest rating, free breakfast, and complimentary wifi access for the duration of your stay.
User: Money don't matter! Free breakfast is what counts, no cooking, yay! Plus wifi so they can play their games.  Book us in, I need a vacation!
Wizard: Ok, youâ€™ve got it! I will confirm your booking via email shortly.
