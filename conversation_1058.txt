Wizard: Well, there are many places we can send you to from Toluca. Do you have any preference whatsoever? Departure date? Budget?
User: i have 4 thousand, eighth hundred dollars... and i can travel between sept 6-19
Wizard: I have a very good package for you at 2925.98USD. This deal is a 15 day stay at the 5 STAR Hotel Serene Palms Resort in Leon, Spain, on the beach, close to the palace.
User: oh wow that sounds amazing!! is there a spa?? can i get free breakfast??
Wizard: No spa or free breakfast at this one
User: well where else can i go
Wizard: My next highest rated hotel is the Hotel Grand Residence, 4 star rated hotel near shopping and the cathedral located in Rome. Includes breakfast and wifi but still no spa.
User: ok what's the next best?
Wizard: The Elton in Houston, 2.5 stars, located near the mall, includes parking, wifi and breakfast
User: not impressive... so.. Rome or Leon
well Leon is a nicer hotel - how long is the Rome trip tho?
Wizard: 14 days
User: minor difference. I prefer Leon in that case
Wizard: Do you want me to start the process of booking Leon for you?
User: yeah, do that please
Wizard: It has been booked!
User: much appreciated
