User: Mexico to Ulsan, pronto
Wizard: I will take pronto to mean as soon as possible. For how many globetrotters will that be?
User: There will be but one
Wizard: and during what travel period may that be?
User: Aug 31 to Sept 17
Wizard: I am afraid I cannot oblige your request since there is nothing available at that time. Any other destinations I can verify for you?
User: Nothing? Ok what about Puebla to Punta Cana
Wizard: I cannot oblige that request either.
User: Mexico City?
Wizard: No packages available there either
User: One last tryâ€¦Puebla to Kingston?
