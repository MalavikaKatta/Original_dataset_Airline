User: Hello, I want to leave from Seoul on August 27 and return on September 9. You can go to Manaus.
Wizard: Do you have a maximum budget for this travel package?
User: No budget, I show me an array of packages with varying prices
Wizard: Only one travel package for Mainaus is available for a departure on August 27th at 8:00 a.m.  The hotel is very good, with a 6.77/10 guest rating.  However, the return date is August 31st at 1:00 a.m. for this travel package.  I have no other locations available for these departure and arrival dates.  Would you like to book this travel package?
User: Would I be staying in a room with an ocean front view? How much would it cost to upgrade to such a room?
Wizard: I'm sorry, I do not have that information
User: Does the hotel have a gym which guests can access?
Wizard: Yes there is a gym.  Would you like to book this travel package?
User: Please. Thanks
