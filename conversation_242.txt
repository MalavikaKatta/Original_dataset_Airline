User: Hi my work colleagues and I want to go to the car rally in Santo Domingo. We can leave from Belem. The rally starts August 24.
Wizard: How many people will you be traveling with?
User: We are 4 people in total. Car aficionados. There's a rally in Minneapolis too if you have anything there that is better.
Wizard: Unfortunately I can't find any flights to Minneapolis that would get you to your destination on time. If you are flying out to Santo Domingo on the 24th of August I can book you for 11 days in the Summer Rose for 6159.78USD.
User: Do you have anything to Minneapolis from Dublin ?
Wizard: I can't find any packages from Dublin to Minneapolis for the 24th of August.
User: Can you tell me more about the Summer Rose in Santo Domingo then?
Wizard: It is a 4-star hotel with a 8.8/10 guest rating, free breakfast, free wifi and free parking. This hotel is located conveniently located close to  the beach and a major shopping center. You would be flying out on Wednesday, August 24th at 2:00 p.m. and returning Saturday, September 3rd at 4:00 a.m. Would you like me to book this package?
User: Near the beach, well that sounds great as the rally is on the beach.  I'm gonna have to call you back though cause I'm not sure if my work colleagues are good with Santo Domingo. This leaves from Belem, correct?
Wizard: yes 
User: Okay okay whew yes just book it sounds great sounds fantastic
