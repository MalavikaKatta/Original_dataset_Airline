User: I'm in Ciudad Juarez and I have to transport a little "package" with me across the border. It has to be done between September 8 and the 28th. We are going to make this a family trip, like in that movie We are the Millers. LOL.
Wizard: Where are you travelling?
User: Anywhere which gets us across the border. LOL.
Wizard: I don’t understand. How many of you are travelling?
User: We are 3 adults and 3 kids.
Wizard: I can get the six of you to Rosario, Argentina for $18194.
User: I need to find something for under $14800
Wizard: I have a 2 star hotel in Rosario for 13646.60USD. The stay would last 18 days,
User: From when to when?
Wizard: September 10-27.
User: Those dates seem to work and the price is more suitable. I'll take that one.
Wizard: Sure! Do you want any more details before I proceed with the booking?
User: No, just need to get across the border.
Wizard: Ok, I’ll just book it for you now then.
User: Thank you
Wizard: My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
