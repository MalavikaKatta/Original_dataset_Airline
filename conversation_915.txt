User: Rome where I can drink some nice red wine while the run amok
Wizard: And where did you want to leave from?
User: Calgary
Wizard: What kind of budget are we working with?
User: I can spend my entire winnings of $4300 who knows how long I'll be around
Wizard: I have a 12 day package for one adult and six kids for 8820.42USD.
User: that would be fun except I would have to rob a bank to get the difference
Wizard: Where else would you like to travel?
User: Leon also has nice red wine
Wizard: Though I hear Leon, Spain is a hotspot for wine, unfortunately I have no packages available for you.
User: ...okay how about Minneapolis, cause they must have some nice red wines there
Wizard: I have a wonderful 8 day package available for you and your family to Minneapolis, USA for only 2619.68USD! How does that sound?
User: It sounds good but we MUST be near the park so I can relax and drink my wine while the children run amok
Wizard: For a total cost of 3340.79USD I can book you an alternative package at Viridian Cottage Inn & Suites. This hotel is near a park, museum, and a mall! Plenty of places to enjoy the highly acclaimed wines of vineyards in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
User: I do hear Pennsylvania puts out some nice wines :mask: Is breakfast for the children included? And what is the rating on this hotel?
Wizard: Breakfast is included! And the rating is 2.5 stars.
User: Did I mention they start school on Sept 29 so we must be back?
Wizard: You would be back on September 19th!
User: They don't get out of camp until Sept 14 so we cannot fly out before then.
Wizard: That’s ok - you would be flying out on September 16th.
User: So this is like a 4 day package?
Wizard: That’s right!
User: Well it all sounds really good except for the crappy Minneapolis, Minnesota wines. Please go ahead and process this before I change my mind.
Wizard: You’ve got it- email confirmation will be sent along shortly.
User: Thank you, my dear, sweet friend, you have been oh so helpful.
Wizard: Happy to help :slightly_smiling_face:
