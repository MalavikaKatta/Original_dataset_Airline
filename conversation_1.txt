User: I'd like to book a trip to Atlantis from Caprica on Saturday, August 13, 2016 for 8 adults. I have a tight budget of 1700.
Wizard: Hi...I checked a few options for you, and unfortunately, we do not currently have any trips that meet this criteria.  Would you like to book an alternate travel option?
User: Yes, how about going to Neverland from Caprica on August 13, 2016 for 5 adults. For this trip, my budget would be 1900.
Wizard: I checked the availability for this date and there were no trips available.  Would you like to select some alternate dates?
User: I have no flexibility for dates... but I can leave from Atlantis rather than Caprica. How about that?
Wizard: I checked the availability for that date and there were no trips available.  Would you like to select some alternate dates?
User: I suppose I'll speak with my husband to see if we can choose other dates, and then I'll come back to you.Thanks for your help
