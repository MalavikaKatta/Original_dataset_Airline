User: How's the hotel though?
Wizard: 4 stars all around. Both include wifi and breakfast but one of them is near the museum and the palace.
User: I'd like to be away from the crowds if possible, so probably the hotel which isnt near anything. Though whats the guest rating?
Wizard: 8.49 / 10 whereas the one near the museum and palace is 9.16 / 10
