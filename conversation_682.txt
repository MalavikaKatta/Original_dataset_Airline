User: you can send me to Manaus pronto
Wizard: I'd love to do just that, but where are you departing from?
User: Curitiba
Wizard: Sure, how does 12 nights at the Hotel Aquamarine River sound?
User: well I don't know anything about the hotel aquamarine so......
Wizard: Its a 2.5 star hotel conveniently situated near shopping. Its got a full suite of amenities, from free wifi, to parking to breakfast, which has garnered it a sparkling 6.77/10 guest rating!
User: needs a higher rating
Wizard: Sure, I can also offer you 9 nights at the Tranquil Sanctuary Hotel, a 3 star hotel with a 8.49/10 rating. How does that sound?
User: also bad. What else
Wizard: This is the best hotel we've got in the city. Would you like to try a different destination?
User: yeah fine. look in Denver for me. 5 stars please
Wizard: We haven't got a 5 star hotel in Denver - would you be interested in a 4 star hotel with a 8.69/10 guest rating instead?
User: possibly.. does it have a spa?
Wizard: No spa but it does have free wi-fi!
