User: 4 children. just me as an adult
Wizard: Do you have any specific dates in mind?

Wizard: The Hotel Regal Universe in Paris is a 4 star property with a 9.16/10 user rating and is located near the museum and palace. That one is available for a 13 day period. I also have the Queen's Jungle Hotel, also a 4 star property with a 8.69/10 user rating located near the museum, shopping and cathedral available for 12 days. A third option for you would be the Autumn Treasure Hotel, again a 4 star property with a 8.49/10 user rating but I do not have any details on its location, also available for 12 days.
