Wizard: Okay! Where will you leave from?
User: Santiago
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: Not for Santa Cruz
Wizard: Ok. Are you traveling alone?
User: To Santa Cruz, yes
Wizard: When would you like to leave?
User: Anytime, I'll schedule the meeting once I get my flights confirmed
Wizard: We have no flights from Santiago to Santa Cruz
User: Okay I thought that may be the case so I have a back-up plan. Fly me to Washington from Santiago with my 5 colleagues then. No more than 2600 though.
Wizard: There are still no results.
User: Can you try Tofino then? For 12 of us?
Wizard: Budget?
User: 2000
Wizard: Nothing.
User: Ridiculous
