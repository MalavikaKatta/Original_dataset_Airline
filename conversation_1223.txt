User: I have never used this chat thing before I hope I am doing it right I need to book a most awesome vacation for my grandson and I
Wizard: So is that for 1 kid and 1 adult? Where are you based and where are you looking to go?
User: Yes my grandson and I. I won $3600 in the slots you know so i want to give him the best birthday vacation ever he has never been anywhere you know, neither have I . I would like to go to Lima, I heard the weather is very nice there. What do you think of Can cun, my cousing Joe used to live there.
Wizard: Okay but where are you guys from?
User: San Juan. I have lived here for 45 years I moved there after I married his grandfather, he's passed now, he was a good man, I really miss him. My grandson is the light of my life now, his mama works too much.
Wizard: We have an 11 day package at a 4 star hotel, with a park nearby.  It costs 1698.75 for an economy flight and 2022.80 for business. Would you be interested?
User: Do you think my grandson would like that?
Wizard: You would love the park and the free wifi. And flying is always fun!
User: What about La Paz. Is there anything fun for him to do in La Paz?
Wizard: Why yes! We have a lovely 7 day package at a 4 star hotel with free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi, all coming to a total of 2527.89 for economy and 3138.47 for business class. Does this entice you?
User: We can only leave after Sept 11 and we need to be back before the start of school on Sept 25th. Do both these packages suit the dates?
Wizard: I'm afraid only the La Paz one does. Would you like to book?
User: I guess if only La Paz suits the dates then La Paz it is. Yes please go ahead and book and take care sweetie.
Wizard: Consider it booked! Enjoy your trip with your grandson.
User: Thank you kindly
