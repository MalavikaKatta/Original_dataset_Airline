User: Hi, do you have flights out of Tel Aviv?
Wizard: For one person? Any travel dates in mind?
User: Nope, I wish! I will be dragging 4 other adults with me. No set dates specifically..
Wizard: It seems we have no flights out of Tel Aviv. Can I search other departure cities for you?
User: Darn it, okay I can also leave from Beijing
Wizard: I'm not showing any results out of Beijing either,
User: That is very unfortunate. Thanks for your help though!
Wizard: You are welcome
