User: Hi! I have 4 children and I would like to take them to Santa Cruz to visit their mom. We are in Monterrey.
Wizard: So will it just be 1 adult and 4 children then?  Do you have a budget in mind?
User: Correct. And no budget, Iâ€™m willing to spend whatever for my kids to see their mum
Wizard: Do you have any dates in mind? And how long do you plan on travelling for?
User: Nope! Whatever is available. We arent picky
Wizard: I'm afraid we don't have any packages available from Monterrey to Santa Cruz. Would you like to leave from another city?
User: I cant leave from anywhere else but we can go to San Juan instead.
Wizard: I have a wonderful 9 day package in San Juan that includes a 4 star hotel with a guest rating of 8.98/10.  Economy class would cost 3249.23 and business would be 3971.57 for all of you.  Are you interested?
User: Is there anything shorter?
Wizard: Yes, we have a 6 day economy package  that comes to a total of 4987, does that interest you?
User: Is that the shortest package?
Wizard: Yes indeed. Would you like to book it?
User: Sure! Thank you
Wizard: Perfect. Consider it booked. You will receive an email shortly.
