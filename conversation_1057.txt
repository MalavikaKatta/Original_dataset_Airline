User: Hi there, I'm looking to go to Stuttgart please.
Wizard: I can help with that! Where will you be coming from?
User: I'll be coming from Hiroshima.
Wizard: How many people will be traveling?
User: Just me! I'm thinking of going there for a while.
I'm thinking about 6 weeks or so. I'm kinda flexible.
Wizard: We have a 6 day trip from September 20-24 at a 3 star hotel. Will this work for you?
User: 6 weeks, not 6 days. Sorry! Can you do that?
Wizard: Unfortunately the 6 day trip is the only offer we have for Stuttgart. Is there somewhere else you would like to go?
User: Oh I see. In that case, do you have any trips to Kingston anytime soon?
Wizard: Yes we do! When would you like to go?
User: Sometime this week or next week. I'm flexible.
Wizard: The longest trip we have is a 10 day trip from September 8-16. Or would you be interested in shorter trips?
User: Yeah, shorter trips would be great.
Wizard: In that case, I'd like to recommend our best hotel in Kingston. A 4.0 star hotel close to the museum. We offer 7 day trips here.
User: That sounds great. Could you give me more details?
Wizard: Of course. It has a a guest rating of 8.22/10 and offers free parking, free breakfast, and free wifi. The trip will run from September 12-17.
User: That sounds really good. Can you add anything to the package?
Wizard: I will not be able to do that; however, you can visit the museum that is very closeby.
User: Okay cool, thanks. How much does it come to?
Wizard: It will be 4041.98 if you choose to fly economy. Or you can update to business flights for a total of 5241.40.
User: I'll take business please.
Wizard: Sounds good! You are headed to Kingston! Booking confirmation will come via email. Anything else for today?
User: Nope, I'm all good, thanks!
Wizard: Glad to help :slightly_smiling_face:
