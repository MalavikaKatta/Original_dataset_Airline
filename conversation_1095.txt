User: I wanna leave Tel Aviv & go 2 Vitoria with 11 adults and we will spend 2000 at most
Wizard: I'm sorry, we currently do not serve flights out of Tel Aviv but hope to do so in the future. Would you be able to leave from somewhere else for now?
User: :eye: guess :eye: could leave from Tofino
Wizard: Sadly we don't have any available trips out of Tofino either. Would you have another alternative?
User: no. ugh. i guess i'll look somewhere else.
