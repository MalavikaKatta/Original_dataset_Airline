User: This is a little short notice But I'm trying to get of San Diego for a bit
I'd like to travel between Sept 8 and 17
Wizard: Where would you like to go?
User: Rome?
Wizard: Do you have a budget?
User: No budget for now
Wizard: And travelling alone?
User: Yes
Wizard: Would you rather travel from September 8th to 16th or September 11th to 15th? Both hotels are 4 stars and offer free breakfast and wifi.
User: I think the longer stay would be best! How much would that cost for economy flights?
Wizard: 2555.13 for economy flights.
User: Cool. I have a number of other cities on my list
Next up is Busan
You fly there?
Wizard: Yes! Here, we have a 3 star hotel near a park, museum, and university, 6.77/10 guest rating, free parking, breakfast, and wifi. This package is from the 12th to 15th of September. Business flights cost 4644.15, economy flights cost 3566.45.

Can you also look at Vancouver?
